In

famous
for
its

Susan

the

stealth
chef.

of
the

her
culinary

in

by
apprenticing

to
a
French

working

to
New

year

in

and
even
though
she
feels
pretty
confident
about
what
she

doing,
Ms.
Spicer
thinks
she
has
a
long
way
to
go.

she
said,
on
a
recent
afternoon

Spicer
,
who
has
dark
blond
hair
and
intense
pale
blue
eyes,
describes
herself
as
shy,
but
she
does
not
go
unnoticed:
people
always
remember
her
because
of
the
band
she
wears
across
her
forehead
when
she
cooks.

hippie
traits
are
disguised.

who
have
seen
her
conduct
a
cooking
class
describe
her
as
lively
and
funny,
sharing
intimate
secrets
of
her
private
life,
talking
about
her
younger
boyfriend,
for
example,
who
is
also
the
manager
of
her
shop.

describes
this
mingling
of
her
personal
and
professional
lives
as
a
pretty
dangerous
thing
to
do,
adding
in
an
offhanded
manner
that
she
is
past
the
point
of
worrying
about
getting
married.

Spicer
came
to
cooking
in
spite
of
her
father
and
because
of
her
mother.

the

that

that

MIRROR
IMAGE
OF
MARTIN
LUTHER
KING
Charles
Johnson
,
whose
last
novel,
Middle
Passage
was
a
historical
reconstruction
of
slavery,
has
turned
to
more
recent
history
in
Dreamer,
an
imagined
account
of
the
last
days
of
the
Rev.
Dr.
Martin
Luther
King
Jr.
They
are
days
filled
with
evil
premonitions
of
the
tragedy
that
was
to
strike
when
King
was
assassinated
in
Memphis
,
Tenn.
,
30
years
ago.

story
shifts
from
King
's
interior
monologues
to
the
reflections
of
Johnson
's
principal
narrator,
a
shy,
self-conscious
24-year-old
acolyte
of
King
named
Matthew
Bishop
who,
in
the
words
of
the
woman
he
loves,
talks
like
a
thesaurus.

of
Johnson
's
themes
is
Matthew
's
growth
from
a
kind
of
intellectually
precocious
late
adolescence
to
full
manhood;
indeed,
one
suspects
that
Matthew
is
modeled
on
Johnson
's
youthful
self.

Johnson
's
narrative
is
aimed
principally
at
the
appearance
of
an
entirely
fictional
character,
Chaym
Smith
,
a
global
wanderer
and
striver
after
redemption
who
bears
an
uncanny
physical
resemblance
to
King
.

a
result,
Chaym
earns
a
role
as
a
stand-in
for
King
at
a
time
when
his
life
was
clearly
in
danger.

Chaym
's
presence
gives
Johnson
's
novel
the
ambiguous,
Conradian
eeriness
of
all
stories
about
the
doppelganger,
the
double,
the
mirror
image
and
the
opposite,
the
reminder
of
the
invisible
person
who
lies
behind
the
mask.

themes
are
rich,
and
they
are
developed
by
Johnson
with
his
usual
stylishness.

has
lived
his
life
shadowed
by
King
's
fame
and
his
status
as
a
kind
of
living
saint.

Johnson
's
vision,
that
experience
has
made
him
both
jealous
and
driven,
admiring
and
vengeful.
Johnson
reminds
us
that
King
was
a
minister
as
well
as
a
leader
of
the
struggle
for
black
rights,
and
Dreamer
is
full
of
theological
reflections.

biblical
story
of
Cain
,
whose
sacrifice
was
rather
inexplicably
rejected
by
God
,
resounds
through
the
novel
as
Chaym
asks
why
he
has
been
cursed
even
as
blessings
pour
down
on
King
.

are

folds
to
Johnson
's
psychological
intrigue.

a
powerful
character,
eloquently
irascible,
morally

yet
Dreamer
is
not
a
complete
success,
despite
the
consistently
high
quality
of
Johnson
's
writing.

the
end
especially,
Johnson
seems
to
lose
control
of
his
doppelganger
theme.

Dreamer
turns
to
a
muddled
theme
of
betrayal
involving
an
unlikely
pair
of
federal
agents
and
Chaym
.

betrayal
seems,
at
least
by
virtue
of
its
timing,
linked
to
King
's
assassination,
though
this
is
far
from
clear.

is
as
though
Johnson
himself
did
not
know
quite
what
to
do
with
the
forces
he
has
set
into
motion.

recourse
to
a
kind
of
unresolved
and
implausible
mystery
leaves
the
reader
with
a
sense
of
incompleteness,
anticlimax.

while
that
might
be
an
intentional
reflection
of
the
deeper
incompleteness
of
real
life,
a
lesson
in
the
unresolvability
of
things
does
not
seem
to
have
been
Johnson
's
purpose.

The
action
of
Dreamers
takes
place
mostly
in
Chicago
,
where
King
,
having
achieved
major
victories
in
the
South,
has
arrived
to
campaign
against
Northern
forms
of
racial
discrimination.
Johnson
's
King
is
tired
and
tearful
and
assailed
by
doubts.

wonders
in
particular
if
he
has
overestimated
the
spiritual
capacity
of
blacks

whites
alike,
whether
they
are
capable
of
understanding
his
deeper,
esoteric
message
about
freedom,
namely
that
to
gain
the
dizzying
heights
of
the
mountaintop,
the
self's
baggage
had
to
be
abandoned
in
the
valley.
Chaym
Smith
arrives
at
King
's
door
in
the
midst
of
these
ruminations.

Negro

years

Matthew
says
of
Chaym
's
appearance:
sullen,
ill-kept,
the
very
embodiment
of
the
blues.
Chaym
volunteers
to
be
King
's
stand-in,
a
role
he
has
been
unhappily
playing
most
of
his
life
anyway.

King
refuses,
Chaym
tells
him,
I

I'm

of
you,
I
might's

Matthew

Amy

the
unreciprocating
object
of
Matthew
's
desire,
to
take
care
of
him.

a
background
of
increasing
urban
violence

`MEISTERSINGER
VON
NURNBERG':
IN
NEED
OF
INSPIRATION
NEW
YORK
_
When
the
Metropolitan
Opera
first
presented
the
Otto
Schenk
production
of
Wagner
's
Meistersinger
von
Nurnberg
in
1993,
Schenk
's
work,
though
conservative,
was
evocative
and
colorful,
and
James
Levine
's
conducting
was
spacious
and
nuanced.

the
production
was
brought
back
two
seasons
ago,
the
production
was
even
more
humane,
and
Levine
's
conducting
more
luminous.

Meistersinger
returned
on
Monday
night.

original
reason
for
bringing
it
back
was
that
the
great
bass
James
Morris
was
planning
to
sing
his
first
Hans
Sachs
,
one
of
opera's
longest
roles,
Wagner
's
wise
shoemaker,
a
widower
in
medieval
Nurnberg
and
the
most
beloved
member
of
the
town's
guild
of
master
singers.

Morris
withdrew
last
fall,
and
the
Met
had
to
come
up
fast
with
a
replacement.

James
Johnson
,
an
American
bass
making
his
house
debut,
the

a
creditable

Levine

and
organic
work

even
deeper

around.

on
Monday
positively
glowed.

onstage
there
was
a
sense
of
a
production
thrown
together
and
lacking
inspiration,
and
the
likely
cause
was
the
jokey
and
intrusively
busy
stage
direction
of
David
McClintock
.

Meistersinger
is
a
comedy,
but
a
tender,
insightful
and,
at
times,
troubling
comedy,
not
the
antic
fest
it
sometimes
seemed
here.

for
example,

depiction
of
Beckmesser

he

and
his
scheming
to
outmaneuver
Sachs
show
him
to
be
hapless,
not
nasty
or
stupid.
Hans-Joachim
Ketelsen
,
the
German
baritone,
sang
the
role
splendidly
but
was
not
helped
by
the
stage
direction.

his
nighttime
serenade

Eva

pouting

cliched
idea.

and
pains
he
suffers
from
the
town
brawl
set
off
by
his
serenading

inanely
overacted.

from
the
directorial
slips,
there
were
some
vocal
rewards,

from

he
not
been
directed
to
act
like
a
bully,
shoving
Beckmesser
around
at
will,
and
flinging
Eva
at
Walther
(three
times!),
which
the
fatherly
Sachs
would
never
do.
Eva
Johansson

a
Danish
soprano

her

debut,

a
lovely
Eva

the
girlishness
of
her
characterization

too
aggressively
projected,
and
at
full
volume
her
voice
tended
to
turn
harsh
and
wobbly.

Gert
Henning-Jensen

his
debut
as

and
with
his
boyish

a
book
is
not
yet
clear.

an
important
point
is
that
these
are
technologies
that
are
easily
manufactured
and
not
phenomenally
expensive.

much
will
it
cost
then?
Jacobson
says
the
volume
will
probably
retail
for
$2
to
$4
per
reusable
page,
or
$500
to
$1,000
for
a
book
that
is
every
book,
although
he
is
working
on
ways
to
reduce
costs
even
further.

would
be
nice
to
have
a
cost
so
low
that
you
could
lose
the
book
without
worrying
about
it
too
much,
he
added.

believe
that
will
be
possible.

about
the
cost
of
the
contents?
Books
in
the
public
domain
could
be
downloaded
for
nothing,
Jacobson
says.

new
works
and
books
still
in
copyright,
a
system
of
royalties
could
be
set
up
in
which
texts
would
be
encrypted
and
readers
would
buy
the
access
code
by
Internet,
phone
or
wireless
transaction.

questions
remain
unanswered.

are
the
implications
for
the
publishing
industry?
Already
any
writer
can
post
a
book
on
the
Internet.

books
will
still
need
to
be
edited
and
promoted.

about
libraries?
Bookstores?
Remainders?
Used
books?
First
editions?
Rare
books?
Copies
inscribed
by
the
author?
Autographing
parties?
What,
in
heaven's
name,
is
to
become
of
the
dearly
beloved
book
borrower?
Will
books
no
longer
furnish
a
room?
It
looks
as
if
they
won't,
unless,
like
me,
you
will
still
insist
on
having
certain
titles
on
the
shelf,
to
remind
you
of
their
existence
and
your
promise
to
yourself
to
read
them
some
day.

likes
of
us
will
have
to
keep
on
collecting
old-fashioned
books.

maybe
resort
to
displaying
those
Potemkin
villages
of
books
on
our
shelves,
rows
and
rows
of
our
favorite
titles
in
colors
that
match
the
furniture
and
the
pets.

one
of
them
will
be

and
removable
from

contain
not
hollowed-out
pages
with
a
gun
or
a
whisky
flask
or
cash
or
diamonds,
but
a
treasure
far
greater:
at
the
touch
of
a
button,
any
book
ever
written.

when
it
is
removed,
family
members
will
be
free
to
ask
a
question
that
might
once
have
reflected
a
certain
benightedness:
Hey!
they'll
be
able
to

out.

SMITHSONIAN
CLOSES

UNITS
The
Smithsonian
Institution
in
Washington
has
shut
down
three
divisions
producing
books,
records,
and
videos,
most
notably
the
Smithsonian
Collection
of

,
which
has
issued
widely
praised
albums
of
jazz
and
popular
music.

said
on
Tuesday
that
they
hoped
to
continue
offering
some
of
the

but
the
announcement
of
the
cutbacks,
particularly
of
the

were
met
with
widespread
alarm
and
disappointment
by
scholars
and

Smithsonian
undersecretary
Constance

announced
the
closing
of

the

we
have
in
this
country
to
a
national
museum,
is
so
poverty
stricken
they
can't
keep
this
going.

officials
at
the
Smithsonian
said
the
closing
of
the
recording
division
reflected
problems
with
its
distribution
system,
which
relies
largely
on
direct
mail,
more
than
discontent
with
its
mission.

they
hoped
to
offer
some
recordings
in
the
future
if
the
operation
could
be
made
economically
feasible.

the
current
method
for

intact
the
Smithsonian

open
the
possibility
that
the

continue,
perhaps
under
the
imprint
of
the

her
memo,
Ms.
Newman
said
an
analysis
would
continue
of
the
continuing
operations
to
explore
ways
in
which
the
dissemination
of
scholarly
works
through
a
recordings
and
a
production
program
can
continue
in
some
form.

Smithsonian
Institution
spokesman,
Linda
St.
Thomas
said
on
Tuesday
that
the
Smithsonian
would
like
to
find
a
way
to
continue
some
of
the
recording
functions,
but
that
it
was
too
early
to
tell
in
what
form
and
to
what
degree
that
might
play
out.

said
the
decisions
were
made
against
the
backdrop
both
of
the
financial
needs
of
the
Smithsonian
and
the
changes
in
the
marketplace
that
have
buffeted
many
direct-mail
operations.

understanding
is
that
as
the
direct-mail
environment
has
eroded
overall
for
all
businesses,
those
projects
became
more
and
more
difficult
to
sustain,
said
Peter
Cannell
,
director
of
the
Smithsonian
Institution
Press
,
the
surviving
publishing
arm.

said
employees
at
the
Smithsonian
viewed
the
cutbacks
with
conflicting
feelings.

a
decision
that
is
in
some
ways
sorry
to
see,
he
said.

on
the
other
hand,
any
business
or
institution
has
to
be
able
to
change
with
the
times,
and
that's
what
we're
doing
here.

_
British
Prime
Minister
Tony
Blair
flew
into
Northern
Ireland
on
Tuesday
in
an
urgent
effort
to
remove
a
serious
snag
in
the
peace
negotiations
between
Protestant
and
Roman
Catholic
political
leaders
in
this
mostly
Protestant
British
province.

Blair
said
on
arriving
at
Hillsborough
,
a
government
residence
south
of
Belfast

for
a
meeting
with
David
Trimble
,
the
Protestant
unionist
leader
who
raised
the
new
obstacle
on
Tuesday

Blair
said.

his
office
insisted
that
Blair
had
been
scheduled
to
arrive
in
Belfast
on
Tuesday,
it
was
believed
here
that
his
arrival
had
been
moved
up
from
Wednesday
in
response
to
the
potential
new
crisis.
Trimble
said
a
set
of
proposals
given
to
the
negotiating
parties
early
Tuesday
was
unacceptable,
a
rejection
that
was
widely
seen
as
a
melodramatic
tactic
to
take
the
initiative
in
peace
talks.

the
tactic
could
backfire
and
push
the
talks
to
the
brink
of
a
collapse,
which
would
probably
turn
the
melodrama
into
the
tragedy
of
widespread
violence
by
the
main
Catholic
and
Protestant
guerrilla
groups,
which
are
now
observing
cease-fires.

Tuesday

that
the

would
not
be
extended
and
that
his
job
was
virtually
over
after
nearly
two
years.

prime
minister
arrived
hours
after
the
latest,
and
most
serious,
obstacle
to
agreement
was
advanced
by
Trimble
,
the
leader
of
the
Protestant
Ulster
Unionist
Party
.
Trimble
said
the
proposals,
which
were
put
forward
by
Mitchell
and
have
not
been
made
public,
were
biased
in
favor
of
the
two
Catholic
parties,
the
mainstream
Social
Democratic
Labor
and
Sinn
Fein
,
the
political
wing
of
the
Irish
Republican
Army
.
Blair
sought
to
reassure
Protestants
by
noting
that
it
was
British
and
Irish
policy
that
there
will
be
no
united
Ireland
_
the
ultimate
goal
of
the
IRA
_
unless
it
is
approved
by
a
majority.

is
likely
to
remain
Protestant
well
into
the
next
century.

Trimble
makes
his
own
proposals
in
the
next
two
days,
the
predictable
reaction
would
be
rejection
by
Sinn
Fein
and
possibly
the
Social
Democrats
and
a
rush
of
last-ditch
negotiations
to
get
a
compromise
agreement
by
midnight

argue
for

Trimble

Before

proposals,
I
wish
to
know
from
you
and
the
Irish

principal
Protestant
complaint
with

that

on
Tuesday
for
his
mother's
funeral,
did
not
immediately
comment
on
Trimble
's
rejection
of

Mitchell
proposals.

rejection
was
partly
motivated
by
Trimble
's
need
to
stave
off
the
vehement
criticism
by
the
Rev.
Ian
Paisley
,
who
has
kept
his
Democratic
Unionist
Party
out
of

I
used
to
love
the

perfect
instrument:
portable,
cheap,
and
low-tech,
with
no
moving

to

of
great

invokes

long
and

tradition.

penny

and

provide
one
of
the
primal
sounds
of
Celtic

plaintive
in
slow
airs
and
dizzyingly
nimble
in
dance
tunes.

a
musician
pulls
a
whistle
out
of
a
pocket
and
joins
in
a
melody,
it's
a
surviving
link
to

of

it

revel
in

new-found

they
realize
that
they're
only
the
flavor
of
the
moment,
and
the
moment
never

first
the
new
sound
is
a
novelty,
an
ear-catching
break
from
the
usual
guitars
and
keyboards;
it
leaps
out
of
a
radio
speaker.

in
a
matter
of
years
or
months,
it's
everywhere:
first
the
imitative
bands,
then
the
soundtracks
and
commercials,
in
a
process
that
keeps
speeding
up.

soon
as
they
can
retool,
keyboard
manufacturers
begin
to
include
a
pre-set
simulation
of
the
sound,
so
that
the
local
Top

can
start
inserting
it
into
songs.

then,
the
sound
is
forever

with
its
pop

the

under

pop
radar.

Van
Morrison

with
the
whistle-toting
Chieftains

1988,
he
was
simply
claiming
his
Irish

Paul
Simon
put
a
whistle
solo
in
the
middle
of
You

on
Graceland
in
1986,
he
was
paying
direct
homage
to
South
African
kwela

another
penny
whistle
stronghold.

there
was
no
rush
to
latch
on
to
the
sound.

nearly
a
decade,
the
whistle
tootled
on
in
easy
obscurity.

along
came
the
corporate
Celtic
blockbusters
of
the
late
1990s,
Riverdance
and
Lord

with
a
whistle
skirling
while
ranks
of
vigorous
step-dancers
clattered
away
in

something
like
an
Irish
Triumph

in

with
an
American

he
has
many
a
hair-raising
story
to
tell.

as
often

in

haunting
documentaries,
the
most
interesting
figure

to
be
the
one
behind

Dengler

Herzog

occasional
meditations
on

in

YELTSIN
STRIKES
POSE
OF
POWER
FOR
HIS
OPPONENTS
MOSCOW
_
In
a
meeting
that
was
as
much
political
theater
as
substance,
President
Boris
Yeltsin
summoned
his
opponents
to
the
Kremlin
Tuesday
in
an
attempt
to
show
that
he
has
a
steady
grip
on
the
reins
of
power
and
to
drum
up
support
for
his
new
prime
minister.

much
ballyhooed
political
round
table
took
place
in
the
ornate
St.
Catherine
Hall.

president
held
center
stage
while
Sergei
Kiriyenko
,
the
youthful
aide
that
Yeltsin
picked
to
be
prime
minister,
sat
by
his
side.

television
cameras
captured
Yeltsin
as
he
served
notice
to
his
critics
that
he
had
no
intention
of
abandoning
Kiriyenko
.

projecting
an
image
of
strength,
Yeltsin
portrayed
himself
as
a
reasonable
leader
who
would
try
to
work
with
the
Communist
-dominated
lower
house
of
parliament
.

the
meeting
itself
was
something
less
than
definitive.

the
two-hour
session
ended,
the
back-room
negotiating
over
the
Kiriyenko
nomination
went
on.

think
it
was
a
purely
cosmetic
event,
said
Yevgeny
Volk
,
the
director
of
the
Moscow
office
of
the
Heritage
Foundation
.

we
are
talking
about
is
bargaining.

tactical
terms,
Yeltsin
conducted
a
round
table
so
that
the
Communists
and
nationals
could
say
their
pressure
on
the
government
had
been
answered.
Volk
,
however,
expressed
the
dominant
view
in
Moscow
that
Yeltsin
would
ultimately
succeed
in
winning
parliamentary
approval
of
Kiriyenko
's
appointment.

the
key
question
increasingly
appears
to
be
not
whether
Kiriyenko
will
be
approved
but
what
the
cost
will
be
in
terms
of
symbolic
or
substantive
concessions
by
Yeltsin
in
new
appointments
or
programs.

be
sure,
Yeltsin
was
not
the
only
one
striking
poses.
Gennadi
Zyuganov
,
the
communist
leader,
declared
after
the
meeting
that
the
Communists
would
not
back
Kiriyenko
's
appointment
when
his
nomination
comes
before
Parliament
on
Friday.

that
does
not
mean
that
the
Communists
are
determined
to
block
the
nomination
indefinitely.

political
analysts
believe
that
the
Communists
are
determined
to
appear
resolute
before
a
national
day
of
protest
scheduled
for
Thursday.

Zyuganov
was
careful
not
to
exclude
the
possibility
that
the
Communists
might
eventually
acquiesce
in
the
nomination.
Vladimir
Zhirinovsky
,
the
nationalist
leader
who
is
best
known
for
his
clownish
antics,
said
he
would
back
Kiriyenko
only
on
the
condition
that
he
could
pick
some
of
the
members
of
Yeltsin
's
new
government.
Alexander
Shokhin
,
the
parliamentary
leader
of
Our
Home
Is
Russia
,
the
political
party
founded
by
ousted
prime
minister
Viktor
Chernomyrdin
,
also
suggested
his
party
should
influence
the
composition
of
Yeltsin
's
new
team.
Grigory
Yavlinsky
of
the
liberal
Yablocko
Party
was
the
most
adamant
in
the
opposition
to
Kiriyenko
.

appears
to
be
calculating
that
the
influence
of
his
Yablocko
Party
will
increase
if
he
remains
unambiguously
in
the
opposition
or
if
Kiriyenko
falls
by
the
wayside.

Parliament
's
first
vote
on
the
Kiriyenko
nomination
is
expected
on
Friday.

if
the
Parliament
rebuffs
Yeltsin
,
the
president
has
indicated
he
will
press
again
for
the
Parliament
's
approval
and
he
has
considerable
leverage.

CAN
END
HERE.

MATERIAL
FOLLOWS)
If
the
Parliament
rejects
Yeltsin
's
choice
for
prime
minister
three
times,
the
president
can
disband
the
parliament
and
call
for
new
parliamentary
elections.

parliamentary
deputies
are
loath
to
compete
in
such
early
elections
and
prefer
to
hold
on
their
posts
and
privileges
as
long
as
possible.

Tuesday's
meeting
was
designed
to
avoid
a
confrontation.

the
session,
Yeltsin
said
he
had
considered
several
other
choices,
including
Yegor
Stroyev
,
the
head
of
the
upper
house
of
parliament
and
Moscow
major
Yuri
Luzhkov
,
before
settling
on
the
35-year-old
Kiriyenko
.
Yeltsin
praised
Kiriyenko
's
professionalism
and
said
that
his
new
government
could
include
candidates
from
opposing
factions.
Kiriyenko
is
to
propose
a
list
over
the
next
week
of
officials
that
would
serve
in
the
new
government.
Yeltsin
grandly
declared
that
1998
should
be
a
year
without
confrontation,
overlooking
the
fact
that
he
had
not
bothered
to
consult
the
parliament

of
his
own

before
picking

TRIBAL
ARTISANS?
LOOK
AGAIN
As
a
freshman
in

some
30
years

I
was
a
literature
major
with
a
problem:
I
had
a
token
science
requirement
to
fulfill.

solution?
I
took
a
course
titled
Primitive
Art.
It
was
taught
by
the
anthropology
department,
and
classes
were
held
in
the
local
museum
of
natural
history,
where
African
sculptures
were
jumbled
in
with
geological
specimens
and
stuffed
birds.

status
of
those
sculptures
has
changed
over
time.

more
often
than
not,
they've
found
a
home
in
art
museums.

art
as
a
field
of
study
is
listed
under
art
history,
and
no
field
of
research
is
more
stimulating
or
innovative.

none
carries
so
heavy
a
burden
of
misconceptions.

of
these
has
to
do
with
the
identity
of
African
artists.

took
note
of
who

the
spectacular
statues
and
masks
they
shipped

to
Europe

ethnology,
with
which
the
study
of
African
art
still
overlaps,
concentrates
on
social
traditions
and
belief
systems
rather
than
things,
and
seldom
has
an
eye
out
for
authorship.

whatever
reason,
the
idea
has
long
been
current
in
the
West
that
anonymity
in
art
was
a
cultural
norm
in
Africa
.

this
thinking,
African
art
is
a
collective,
tribal
phenomenon
rather
than
a
vehicle
for

by

with
reliefs
of
dozens
of
figures
arranged
in
horizontal
bands.

of
the
characteristics
of
Olowe
's
personal
style
are
here:
the
unusually
high
relief
carving,
deep-cut
and
verging
on
the
three-dimensional;
figures
with
limbs
modeled
and
flexed
to
give
an
impression
of
movement,
and
surfaces
inflected
with
painterly
chipping
and
faceting.

of
these
features
are
also
found
in
the
extraordinary
veranda
posts
that
Olowe
produced
for
his
royal
patrons.

other
artists
working
with
this
form
carved
their
stacked-up
figures
face-front
and
locked
within
the
column,
Olowe
often
twists
them
in
different
directions,
sets
their
limbs
free
in
space
and
enlivens
them
with
personable
details:
a
young
king
has
the
sweet,
alert
face
of
a
gazelle;
a
hunter,
rifle
in
hand,
wears
his
hair
in
a
thick
braid,
which
curves
out
behind
him
like
a
bow.

radical
is
the
way
Olowe
plays
with
visual
and
social
conventions.

sculptures

reverses
or
blends
gender
roles,
giving
male
figures

by
brides.

he
did
so
is
a
mystery,
but
one
can
assume
that,
like
any
inventive
artist
intent
on
making
a
name
for
himself,
he
upset
expectations
both
to
arrest
the
eye
and
to
keep
his
public
wondering
what
on
earth
he
would
be
up
to

an
absorbing,
exhausting

one
packed
with
fresh
information,
contentious
ideas
(one
scholar
suggested
that
the
issue
of
determining
authorship
in
African

was
a
Western
obsession
geared
to
museums
and
markets),
and,
inevitably,
with
new
misconceptions
that
only
further
research
will
set

it
felt
a
very
long
way
indeed
from
the
dusty
vitrines
and
taxidermic
science
of
30
years

when
African
artists
were
barely
spoken
of
as
artists
at
all,
and
the
energy
of
their
work
was,
for
one
unexpectedly
captivated
student,
a
transformative
secret
just
beginning
to
be
revealed.
