as O
Moody's I-LOCATION

a O
pessimistic O

exchange O
rate O

Japan I-LOCATION

tumbled O
to O
a O
six-and-a-half-year O
low, O
and O
the O

fell O
on O
the O
decision O
by O
the O
American-based O

agency O
to O
change O
its O
view O
on O
Japan I-LOCATION
_ O
whose O

_ O
from O

Moody's I-LOCATION
did O
not O
change O
any O
existing O
bond O
ratings, O
but O
the O
negative O
outlook O
may O
lead O
to O
a O
formal O
review O
in O
18 O
months O

two O
years. O

raise O
borrowing O

for O
all O
Japanese, O
from O
consumers O
to O
large O
corporations, O
even O
those O
with O

such O
a O
move O
could O
further O
weaken O
Japanese O
banks, O
which O
already O
pay O
more O
to O
borrow O
because O
they O
hold O
in O
excess O
of O
$600 O
billion O
in O
bad O

step O
by O
Moody's I-LOCATION
was O
a O
surprise O
because O
even O
with O
Japan I-LOCATION

economic O
problems, O
it O
is O
still O
the O
world's O

Moody's I-LOCATION
lowered O
its O
rating O
of O
the O

typically O
the O

it O
darkened O
its O
outlook O
on O
Japan I-LOCATION

sovereign O
ceiling, O
which O
is O
effectively O
the O
government's O
ability O
to O

Japanese O
borrower O
can O
have O
a O
higher O
rating O
than O
the O
government, O
so O
if O
the O
sovereign O

in O

that O

hurt O
triple-A O

added O
that O
persistent O

had O
made O
Japan I-LOCATION
more O

and O
it O
questioned O
whether O

Moody's I-LOCATION

was O
the O

economic O

in O
Japan I-LOCATION

government O
attempt O

DRUG O
FOR O
IMPOTENCE O
RAISES O
HOPE O
FOR O
ITS O
USE O
BY O
WOMEN, O
TOO O
The O
buzz O
over O
the O
new O
impotence O
drug, O
Viagra, O
has O
prompted O
many O
women O
and O
researchers O
to O
wonder O
whether O
it O
could O
improve O
the O
sex O
lives O
of O
women O
if O
they O
took O
it O
as O
well. O

in O
the O
process, O
it O
is O
generating O
new O
interest O
in O
sex O
research O
in O
general O
and O
women's O
sexual O
problems O
in O
particular. O

decades, O
the O
field O
of O
sex O
research O
has O
been O
a O
scientific O
backwater, O
researchers O
acknowledge. O

federal O
government O
kept O
away O
from O
sex O
research O
and O
serious O
investigators O
considered O
it O
career O
suicide O
to O
go O
into O
an O
area O
that O
lacked O
federal O
financing O
and O
evoked O
snickers O
from O
other O
researchers. O

Viagra O
was O
discovered O
by O
accident. O

Pfizer O
, O
its O
maker, O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
drug O
to O
relieve O
the O
chest O
pain O
of O
heart O
disease. O

compound, O
sildenafil O
citrate O
in O
pill O
form, O
did O
not O
work O
as O
intended, O
but O
it O
had O
an O
unexpected O
side O
effect: O
some O
men O
taking O
Viagra O
found O
that O
it O
resulted O
in O
prolonged O
or O
enhanced O
erections. O

Pfizer I-LOCATION
scientists O
decided O
to O
investigate O
its O
usefulness O
as O
an O
impotence O
remedy, O
they O
had O
to O
learn O
about O
the O
biochemistry O
and O
neurobiology O
of O
erections. O

also O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
developing O
a O
survey O
to O
determine O
whether O
erections, O
sexual O
performance O
and O
sexual O
desire O
improved O
and, O
if O
so, O
by O
how O
much. O

many O
doctors O
want O
to O
know O
whether O
Viagra O
works O
on O
women, O
since O
the O
clitoris O
is O
the O
female O
version O
of O
the O
penis O
and O
thus O
becomes O
engorged O
with O
blood O
during O
sexual O
arousal. O

how, O
they O
ask, O
should O
they O
measure O
arousal O
in O
women, O
especially O
since O
relatively O
little O
is O
known O
about O
sexual O
function O
and O
dysfunction O
among O
women? O
Until O
researchers O
solve O
that O
problem, O
Pfizer I-LOCATION
's O
plans O
to O
test O
the O
effects O
of O
Viagra O
on O
women O
cannot O
begin. O

the O
meantime, O
researchers O
say, O
women O
have O
been O
calling O
them O
and O
asking O
about O
the O
pill. O

even O
asking O
about O
whether O
Viagra O
works O
for O
women O
has O
meant O
starting O
the O
sort O
of O
sex O
research O
that O
has O
been O
stymied, O
experts O
said. O

has O
opened O
the O
door O
to O
the O
study O
of O
sexual O
function, O
said O
Dr. O
Raymond O
Rosen O
, O
a O
sex O
researcher O
and O
professor O
of O
psychiatry O
at O
the O

Brunswick I-LOCATION
, O
N.J. I-LOCATION
While O
some O
welcome O
the O
change, O
others O
ask O
how O
money O
and O
attention O
from O
drug O
companies O
will O
alter O
a O
field O
that O
has O
focused O
as O
much O
on O
feelings O
and O
relationships O
as O
it O
has O
on O
physiology O
and O
mechanics. O

drug O
company O
money, O
the O
studies O
have O
been O
so O
mechanical O
_ O
is O
it O
hard? O
how O
wide O
is O
it? O
how O
big O
is O
it? O
how O
many O
seconds O
does O
it O
last? O
said O
Dr. O
Leonore O
Tiefer O
, O
a O

researcher O
and O
clinical O
professor O
of O
psychiatry O
at O
New I-LOCATION

. O

I O
think O
of O
an O
erection O
as O
a O
means O
to O
an O
end, O
Tiefer O
said, O
something O
suitable O
to O
a O
couple O
rather O
than O
something O
you O
measure O
in O
the O
guy O
in O
the O
lab. O

researchers O
wonder O
whether O
it O
will O
be O
good O
or O
bad O
for O
relationships O
if O
a O
new O
generation O
of O
drugs O
enhances O
sexual O
functioning O
for O
people O
who O
have O
been O
getting O
along O
fine O
with O
less-than-peak O
performance. O

of O
this O
like O
winning O
the O
sexual O
lottery, O
said O
Dr. O
Pepper O
Schwartz O
, O
a O
sociology O
professor O
at O
the O
University I-LOCATION
of I-LOCATION
Washington I-LOCATION
. O

might O
think O
in O
a O
lottery O
that O
if O
a O
little O
money O
is O
good, O
a O
lot O
must O
be O
great. O

that O
is O
not O
always O
true. O

some O
say O
that O
the O
anticipated O
renaissance O
for O
sex O
research O
is O
long O
overdue, O
particularly O
for O
women. O

can O
argue O
that O
as O
a O
society O
sexual O
functioning O
shouldn't O
have O
the O
image O
it O
has, O
said O
Rosen O
. O

sexual O
dysfunction O
for O
the O
people O
involved, O
it O
can O
be O
devastating, O
he O
said. O

anything, O
he O
added, O
sexual O
problems O
are O
more O
common O
in O
women O
than O
in O
men O
and, O
as O
in O
men, O
they O
are O
more O
common O
as O
people O
get O
older. O

women, O
a O
major O
issue O
is O
lack O
of O
desire. O

Rosen O
said O
much O
remained O
unknown: O
What O
is O
the O
relationship O
between O
lack O
of O
desire O
and O
measures O
of O
sexual O
performance O
_ O
lubrication O
and O
arousal? O
Is O
it O
that O
women O
lose O
desire O
and O
then O
develop O
arousal O
difficulties O
or O
is O
it O
the O
other O
way O
around? O
Women O
may O
complain O
of O
a O
lack O
of O
desire O
because O
it O
is O
more O
acceptable O
for O
them O
to O
say O
that O
than O
to O
say O
they O
have O
difficulty O
becoming O
aroused, O
Dr. O
Rosen O
said. O

55-year-old O
nurse O
at O
the O
University I-LOCATION
of I-LOCATION
Maryland I-LOCATION
said O
she O
could O
not O
decide O
whether O
her O
problem O
was O
lack O
of O
desire O
or O
lack O
of O
an O
ability O
to O
become O
aroused. O

you're O
younger, O
you O
could O
look O
at O
someone O
and O
all O
those O
bells O
and O
whistles O
would O
go O
off, O
the O
nurse O
said, O
speaking O
on O
the O
condition O
of O
anonymity. O

when O
you O
are O
with O
your O
partner O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
she O
added, O
a O
certain O
boredom O
sets O
in. O

maybe O
Viagra O
could O
be O
the O
answer O
to O
that, O
she O
said. O

nurse O
said O
she, O
and O
virtually O
every O
woman O
she O
knew, O
would O
like O
to O
try O
Viagra. O

think O
everyone O
wonders O
if O
it O
could O
be O
better, O
she O
said. O

least O
one O
researcher, O
Dr. O
Irwin O
Goldstein O
, O
a O
professor O
of O
urology O
at O
the O
Boston I-LOCATION
University I-LOCATION
School I-LOCATION
of I-LOCATION
Medicine I-LOCATION
, O
said O
his O
research O
indicated O
that O
the O
problem O
for O
middle-aged O
women O
was O
the O
same O
as O
it O
was O
for O
middle-aged O
men: O
a O
paucity O
of O
blood O
flowing O
to O
the O
sex O
organs. O

if O
Goldstein O
is O
correct, O
it O
makes O
at O
least O
theoretical O
sense O
that O
Viagra O
be O
helpful O
for O
women. O

was O
Goldstein O
whose O
survey O
of O
Massachusetts I-LOCATION
men O
indicated O
that O
about O
half O
of O
all O
men O
aged O
40 O
to O
70 O
had O
difficulties O
obtaining O
or O
maintaining O
erections. O

also O
discovered O
that O
the O
problem O
was O
most O
common O
among O
men O
with O
conditions O
that O
can O
lead O
to O
vascular O
problems O
that O
can O
lead O
to O
diminished O
flow O
in O
blood O
vessels, O
like O
diabetes. O

Goldstein O
and O
his O
colleagues O
are O
extending O
their O
research O
to O
women. O

get O
an O
idea O
of O
how O
common O
sexual O
problems O
are O
in O
women, O
Goldstein O
surveyed O
300 O
women O
whose O
partners O
had O
consulted O
him O
about O
impotency. O

sexual O
dysfunction O
as O
discomfort O
during O
sexual O
intercourse, O
dryness, O
increased O
time O
for O
arousal, O
diminished O
ability O
to O
reach O
orgasm, O
or O
diminished O
clitoral O
sensation, O
Goldstein O
found O
that O
58 O
percent O
of O
the O
women O
were O
affected. O

as O
like O
men, O
the O
women O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
have O
sexual O
difficulties O
if O
they O
were O
older O
and O
if O
they O
had O
medical O
conditions O
relating O
to O
vascular O
problems. O
Goldstein O

Dr. O
Jennifer O
Berman O
, O
a O

at O

also O
examined O
the O

and O
those O
of O
women O
undergoing O
X-ray O
examinations O
of O
the O

for O
vascular O

found O
that O
just O
as O

and O
aging O
cause O
blood O
vessels O
to O
narrow O
in O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
body, O
the O
sexual O
organs O
were O
similarly O
affected, O
Goldstein O
said. O

whole O
field O
changes O
now, O
he O
said. O

dysfunction, O
Goldstein O
said, O
is O
no O
longer O
mostly O
a O
psychosomatic O
complaint, O
it O
is O
not O
something O
to O
be O
resolved O
only O
through O
years O

and O
it O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
for O
a O
urologist O
alone. O

he O
said, O
sexual O
dysfunction O
is O
in O
essence O
a O
vascular O
disease. O

is, O
he O
said, O
a O
heart O
attack O
of O

a O

We O

our O

his O

is O
a O
high O

for O
us. O

that O
it O
was O
Republicans I-LOCATION

not O
Clinton O
, O
who O
sought O
more O

Lott O
said, O
He O
needs O
to O
check O

before O

complaining. O

from O
one O
domestic O

to O
another, O
the O

called O
on O

go O
along O
with O
the O

that O
was O
approved O
this O
week O
by O
the O
Senate I-LOCATION

, O
even O
though O
it O
was O
tougher O
on O
the O
companies O
than O
the O
proposed O
settlement O
they O
agreed O
to O
last O

am O
determined O
to O
seize O
this O
historic O
opportunity O
to O
pass O
bipartisan O
legislation O
to O
protect O
our O
children O
from O
the O
dangers O
of O
tobacco, O
he O
said. O

Congress I-LOCATION
can O
be O
the O
Congress I-LOCATION
that O
saves O
millions O
of O

lives. O

cigarette O
companies, O
Clinton O
said, O
needed O
to O
reverse O
the O
record O
of O
the O
past, O
to O
try O
to O
put O
this O
unforgivable O
chapter O
behind O

Lott O
, O
meanwhile, O
said O
that O
if O
the O
tobacco O
settlement O
did O
not O
reach O
the O
Senate I-LOCATION
floor O
by O
June O
1, O
it's O
going O
to O
be O
pretty O
hard O
to O
bring O
it O
to O
a O
vote O
this O
year. O

not O
saying O
it's O
impossible, O
the O
senator O
said. O

I O
think O
that O
the O
best O
time O
to O
do O
it O
would O
be O
before O
we O
go O
out O
for O
the O
Memorial O
Day O
recess. O
Clinton O
was O
unusually O
jaunty O
at O
his O
White I-LOCATION
House I-LOCATION
homecoming O
event. O

to O
put O
the O
best O
face O
on O
figures O
showing O
a O
slight O
rise O
in O
unemployment, O
which O
were O
made O
public O
shortly O
before O
his O
Rose O

appearance, O
he O
said, O
While O
there O
will O
be O
ups O

our O

am O
going O

try O
to O

what O
the O

I O
should O
do, O
which O
is O
not O

in O
such O

that O

while O

in O

hope O

Clinton O

personally O
am O
greatly O
relieved. O

long O
before O

as O
I O
told O
him O
when O
I O

an O

up O

said, O
`I O

you O

And O
it's O
nice O

although O
strong O
results O
from O
a O
rebate-fueled O

by O
General I-LOCATION

helped O
offset O
weak O

at O

GM I-LOCATION
said O
Friday O
that O
its O
sales O
rose O
3.7 O

in O
March, O
compared O
with O

GM I-LOCATION

also O
signaled O
a O
change O
in O
management's O
view O
on O
offering O
the O

and O
other O
incentives O
that O
customers O
love O
but O
investors O
dread. O

company, O
which O
had O
watched O
its O
market O
share O
dwindle O
as O
it O
tried O
to O
avoid O
offering O
costly O
discounts, O
acknowledged O
a O
need O
to O
stabilize O
its O
share O
of O
the O
car O
and O

market. O

is O
no O
one O
in O
General I-LOCATION
Motors I-LOCATION
who O
doesn't O
understand O
and O
believe O
that O
market O

is O
important, O
and O
that's O
the O
way O
we're O
going O
to O
manage O
the O
business O
going O
forward, O
said O
Ronald O

, O
a O
GM I-LOCATION
vice O
president O

the O
absence O
of O
a O
fairly O
crippling O
strike O
or O
labor O
action, O
it O
would O
be O
unlikely O
that O
our O

would O
be O
under O
30 O
percent O
for O
any O
period O
of O

Zarrella O
insisted O
GM I-LOCATION
would O
pay O
for O
the O
expensive O
rebates O
and O
other O
incentives O
by O
cutting O
costs O
elsewhere, O
rather O
than O
by O
turning O
in O
lower-than-expected O
profits. O

are O
going O
to O
be O
competitive O
going O
forward, O
and O
we O
think O
we O
can O
cut O
costs O
enough O
to O
make O
our O
profitability O
objectives O
and O
to O
make O
our O
market O
share O
objectives, O
Zarrella O
said. O

Street O

untroubled O

an O

is O
only O
acknowledging O
the O
realities O
of O
the O
marketplace O
_ O
that O
if O
everyone O
else O
is O
using O
incentives, O
you O
can't O
sell O
without O
incentives. O

she O
said O
GM I-LOCATION
should O
be O
able O
to O
offer O
more O
discounts O
without O
unduly O
crimping O
profits O
because O
it O
could O
cut O
costs O
faster O
than O
it O
would O
need O
to O
increase O
incentives. O

company's O
strategy O
change O
came O
after O
a O
dismal O
showing O
in O
February, O
when O
sales O
were O
so O
weak O
that O
GM I-LOCATION

market O
share O
skidded O
to O
28.7 O
percent, O
well O
below O
the O
30 O

GM I-LOCATION
fought O
back O

Ford I-LOCATION
said O
its O
2.6 O

was O
a O
result O
of O

in O

weeks. O

made O
his O
comments O
as O
evidence O
mounted O
that O
Japan I-LOCATION
, O
already O
languishing O
in O
recession, O
is O
headed O
into O
one O
of O
its O
worst O
downturns O
since O
the O
end O
of O
World O
War O
II, O
and O
the O
yen O
fell O
to O
a O
six-and-a-half-year O
low O
against O
the O

Clinton O
issued O
his O
warning O
to O
Japan I-LOCATION
in O
response O
to O
a O
question O
at O
a O
news O
conference, O
he O
was O
clearly O
ready O
to O
send O
a O
strong O
message, O
saying, O
You O
simply O
can't O
stay O
with O
a O
strategy O
that O
is O
clearly O
not O
appropriate O
to O
the O
times O
and O
expect O
it O
to O
get O
the O
results O
that O
are O
needed O
for O
the O
country. O

months O
U.S. I-LOCATION
officials O
have O
become O
increasingly O
specific O
about O
what O
they O
believe O
Japan I-LOCATION
must O
do, O
advocating O
huge O
tax O
cuts O
and O
old-fashioned O
deficit O
spending O
to O
spur O
an O
economy O
that O
many O
experts O
say O
could O
shrink O
by O
2 O
percent O
this O
year. O

president O
was O
careful O
to O
praise O
Japan I-LOCATION
's O
embattled O
prime O
minister, O
Ryutaro O
Hashimoto O
, O
as O
an O
able O
man, O
but O
he O
said O
there O
was O
clearly O
an O
ongoing O
struggle O
with O
an O
entrenched O
bureaucracy. O

comments O
stepped O
up O
the O
recent O
public O
pressure O
from O
Treasury I-LOCATION
Secretary O
Robert O
Rubin O
and O
leaders O
from O
several O
of O
the O
world's O
biggest O
economic O
powers, O
who O
have O
said O
repeatedly O
that O
Japan I-LOCATION
's O
economic O
decline O
and O
its O
inability O
to O
absorb O
imports O
from O
neighboring O
countries O
threaten O
to O
undermine O
Asia I-LOCATION
's O
fragile O
recovery. O
U.S. I-LOCATION
officials O
have O
a O
more O
specific O
concern: O
the O
risk O
that O
a O
collapse O
of O
more O
major O
Japanese O
banks O
and O
securities O
dealers O
could O
imperil O
Wall O
Street, O
just O
as O
the O
Dow I-LOCATION
Jones I-LOCATION
Industrial O
Average O
crossed O
9,000 O
for O
the O
first O
time. O

is O
hardly O
a O
foregone O
conclusion. O

U.S. I-LOCATION
companies O
are O
already O
reporting O
that O
their O
exports O
to O
Asia I-LOCATION
are O
dropping O
drastically, O
and O
a O
collapse O
in O
Japan I-LOCATION
, O
many O
say, O
could O
start O
a O
new O
round O
of O
economic O
contagion O
that O
could O
reach O
further O
than O
the O
crises O
in O
Southeast I-LOCATION
Asia I-LOCATION
and O
South I-LOCATION
Korea I-LOCATION
. O

officials O
made O
clear O
that O
Clinton O
's O
comments O
Friday O
had O
been O
carefully O
planned. O

been O
building O
to O
this O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
one O
senior O
official O
said. O

looking O
at O
an O
economic O
actor, O
the O
world's O
second-largest O
economy, O
whose O
decisions O
affect O
the O
globe, O
and O
there O
is O
a O
growing O
sense O
that O
they O
are O
not O
up O
to O
the O
task, O
that O
they O
do O
not O
understand O
the O
gravity O
of O
the O
situation O
for O
Japan I-LOCATION
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world. O

is O
simply O
a O
loss O
of O
confidence. O

Thursday O
the O
chairman O
of O
Sony I-LOCATION
Corp. I-LOCATION
, O
Norio O
Ohga O
, O
a O
man O
not O
given O
to O
alarmist O
statements, O
warned O
that O
Japan I-LOCATION
's O
economy O
is O
on O
the O
verge O
of O
collapsing. O

compared O
Prime O
Minister O
Hashimoto O
to O
President O
Hoover O
on O
the O
eve O
of O
the O
1929 O
stock-market O
collapse O
in O
the O
United I-LOCATION
States I-LOCATION
. O

you O
look O
at O
what O
Hoover O
was O
saying O
at O
the O
start O
of O
the O
Great O
Depression O
and O
what O
Hashimoto O
is O
saying O
at O
the O
moment, O
they O
are O
very O
similar, O
Ohga O
warned. O

CAN O
END O
HERE O
_ O
OPTIONAL O
MATERIAL O
FOLLOWS) O
But O
the O
sharp O
reactions O
in O
Japan I-LOCATION
's O
stock O
and O
currency O
markets O
seem O
to O
have O
been O
driven O
by O
two O
different O
events. O

first O
was O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Japanese O
fiscal O
year O
on O
Tuesday. O

days O
before O
that O
deadline, O
the O
Japanese O
government O
was O
investing O
heavily O
in O
the O
country's O
stock O
market, O
trying O
to O
boost O
the O
price O
of O
stocks O
held O
by O
Japan I-LOCATION
's O
banks, O
which O
are O
burdened O
with O
hundreds O
of O
billions O
of O
dollars O
of O
bad O
debts. O

goal O
was O
to O
make O
year-end O
balance O
sheets O
appear O
far O
sounder O
than O
they O
really O
were, O
so O
banks O
would O
meet O
international O
requirements O
for O
lending O
around O
the O
world. O

the O
stock O
prices O
never O
rose O
as O
far O
as O
Japanese O
officials O
had O
hoped, O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
deadline O
passed, O
prices O
dropped O
steeply. O

second O
alarm O
came O
from O
Moody's I-LOCATION
Investors I-LOCATION
Service I-LOCATION
, O
one O
of O
the O
world's O
leading O
financial O
rating O
agencies, O
which O
issued O
an O
unusual O
warning O
about O
Japan I-LOCATION
on O
Friday. O

Moody's I-LOCATION
did O
not O
drop O
the O
Japanese O
government's O
triple-A O
rating, O
the O
highest O
it O
grants O
to O
any O
country, O
it O
altered O
its O
outlook O
to O
negative. O

there O
is O
virtually O
no O
fear O
that O
Japan I-LOCATION
could O
default O
on O
its O
government O
debt O
_ O
the O
country O
has O
hundreds O
of O
billions O
of O
dollars O
in O
reserves O
_ O
the O
warning O
made O
investors O
who O
fear O
rising O
bankruptcies O
extremely O
skittish. O

United I-LOCATION
States I-LOCATION
has O
been O
warning O
Japan I-LOCATION
to O
take O
far O
stronger O
economic O
action O
for O
more O
than O
18 O
months O
now. O

year O
ago, O
when O
Hashimoto O
visited O
the O
White I-LOCATION
House I-LOCATION
, O
he O
made O
a O
detailed O
economic O
presentation O
to O
Clinton O
, O
Vice O
President O
Al O
Gore O
and O
top O
economic O
officials, O
arguing O
that O
a O
3 O
percent O
tax O
increase O
that O
Japan I-LOCATION
was O
imposing O
would O
not O
send O
the O
economy O
into O
a O
tailspin. O

was O
wrong. O

November, O
Hashimoto O
admitted O
that O
the O
tax O
increase, O
which O
had O
been O
pressed O
by O
bureaucrats O
in O
Japan I-LOCATION
's O
Finance I-LOCATION
Ministry I-LOCATION
, O
had O
been O
a O
major O
mistake. O

he O
has O
not O
moved O
to O
repeal O
the O
tax, O
and O
so O
far O
the O
economic O
programs O
he O
has O
announced O
to O
spur O
the O
economy O
have O
been O
a O
murky O
mixture O
of O
new O
and O
previously O
announced O
ones. O
Japan I-LOCATION
's O
ambassador O
to O
Washington I-LOCATION
, O
Kunihiko O
Saito O
, O
said O
Friday O
that O
he O
had O
no O
problem O
with O
the O
mounting O
pressure O
from O
Clinton O
. O

Japanese O
now O
realize O
that O
the O
old O
system O
that O
worked O
in O
the O
past O
doesn't O
work O
anymore, O
he O
said O
Friday. O

have O
to O
reform O
ourselves, O
and O
change O
our O
system. O

he O
added, O
Sometimes O
public O
statements O
can O
be O
counterproductive, O
and O
we O
have O
been O
asking O
U.S. I-LOCATION
officials O
to O
be O
careful O
in O
their O
public O
statements. O

on O
the O

of O
that O

for O
what O
the O

call O
a O
ceremony O
of O

this O

man O
came O
out O
of O

with O

and O
my O

asked, O
`What's O
going O

recalled O
C. O

Gilmour O
, O
88, O
a O
white O
native O
of O
Price I-LOCATION
who O
planned O
the O
ceremony O
from O
his O

in O
Salt I-LOCATION

man O
said, O
`They've O
caught O
him O
_ O
we've O
got O
a O
necktie O
party.' O
That O
was O
the O
phrase O
that O
stuck O
in O
my O
mind O
all O
these O
years: O
`a O
necktie O
party.' O
The O
same O
racism O
that O
shot O
Martin O
Luther O
King O
in O
Memphis I-LOCATION
is O
the O
same O
prejudice O
that O
strung O
up O
Marshall O
in O
Price I-LOCATION
, O
Gilmour O
, O
a O
retired O
lawyer, O
said O
of O
the O
all-white O
mob O
that O
lynched O
an O
itinerant O
black O
miner O
suspected O
of O
murdering O
a O
coal O
company O
guard. O

so, O
says O
Kevin O
Ashby O
, O
publisher O
of O
the O
local O
newspaper, O
The I-LOCATION
Sun I-LOCATION
Advocate I-LOCATION
, O
who O
calls O
the O
reconciliation O
day O
a O
slap O
in O
the O
face O
to O
the O
community O
and O
says O
the O
organizers O
are O
trying O
to O
make O
a O
martyr O
out O
of O
a O
murderer. O

Tuesday, O
Ashby O
, O
who O
like O
other O
critics O
does O
not O
deny O
the O
lynching O
itself, O
published O
a O
long O
editorial O
denouncing O
the O
reconciliation O
day O
as O
an O
imported O
hodgepodge O
of O
correct O
political O
thinking, O
rewriting O
of O
history O
and O
victim O
culture. O

Wednesday, O
he O
said, O
the O
calls O
started O
coming O
in. O

yesterday O
I O
got O
50 O
calls. O

the O
callers O
were O
in O
support O
of O
the O
editorial. O

Thursday O
afternoon, O
one O
of O
those O
callers O
sat O
in O
her O
living O
room, O
the O
blinds O
drawn O
and O
a O
vase O
of O
roses O
from O
her O
80th O
birthday O
sitting O
forgotten O
on O
a O

tears, O
she O
asked O
that O
she O
not O
be O
identified O
by O

why O
resurrect O
this O
thing? O
asked O
the O
woman, O
who O
recalls O
visiting O
the O
jail O
where O
her O
father, O
the O
town O
marshal, O
was O
one O
of O
11 O
men O
briefly O
held O
for O
the O
lynching. O

attack O
the O
second O
and O
third O
generation? O
As O
a O
result O
of O
the O
controversy O
brought O
on O
by O
plans O
for O
the O
gathering, O
she O
said, O
I O
can't O
go O
shopping, O
I O
can't O
go O
to O
the O
beauty O
shop O
_ O
people O
always O
ask O
me O
about O
it. O
Gilmour O
says O
it O
was O
President O
Clinton O
's O
call O
for O
a O
national O
dialogue O
on O
race O
that O
inspired O
him O
and O
the O
other O
organizers O
to O
plan O
ceremonies O
at O
the O
resting O
place O
of O
a O
lynching O
victim O
who O
for O
73 O
years O
has O
lain O
in O
an O
unmarked O
grave. O

with O
the O
reconciliation O
day O
organized O
largely O
by O
outsiders O
from O
Salt I-LOCATION
Lake I-LOCATION
City I-LOCATION
, O
much O
of O
Price I-LOCATION
has O
retreated. O

by O
geography, O
Carbon I-LOCATION
County I-LOCATION
, O
with O
only O
20,000 O
residents, O
has O
long O
felt O
alienated O
from O
Salt I-LOCATION
Lake I-LOCATION
City I-LOCATION
, O
120 O
miles O
to O
the O
northwest. O

industrial, O
Democratic O
and O
a O
religious O
and O
ethnic O
mix, O
the O
county O
is O
an O
anomaly O
in O
a O
state O
that O
is O
overwhelmingly O
anti-union, O
Republican O
and O
Mormon. O

again, O
Carbon I-LOCATION
County I-LOCATION
gets O
the O
black O
mark, O
objected O
J. O

Dorman O
, O
an O
88-year-old O
retired O
doctor, O
echoing O
a O
sentiment O
heard O
around O
town. O

was O
not O
a O
racist O
thing O
at O
all. O

Marshall O
had O
been O
an O
Italian O
or O
a O
Greek, O
he O
would O
have O
gotten O
the O
same O
thing. O

events O
of O
the O
period O
suggest O
the O
contrary. O

instance, O
in O
a O
mining O
strike O
here O
three O
years O
before O
the O
lynching O
of O
Marshall O
, O
workers O
shot O
and O
killed O
two O
coal O
company O
guards. O

Greek O
immigrant O
miners O
were O
arrested, O
tried O
and O
convicted. O

was O
sentenced O
to O
20 O
years O
in O
prison, O
the O
others O
to O
life. O

community, O
church O
and O
labor O
support O
for O
them O
applied O
the O
brake O
to O
any O
inclination O
toward O
vigilantism. O

contrast, O
Marshall O
, O
hanged O
amid O
a O
bitter O
later O
strike, O
was O
one O
of O
only O
100 O
or O
so O
blacks O
in O
the O
entire O
county. O

had O
no O
family O
nearby, O
no O
church O
to O
support O
him. O

the O
ceremony's O
critics O
point O
out, O
Marshall O
had O
a O
criminal O
record O
and, O
by O
the O
account O
of O
historians, O
did O
shoot O
the O
guard, O
five O
times. O

whether O
he O
was O
guilty O
or O
not O
is O
irrelevant, O
said O
Larry O
Gerlach O

After O

the O

March, O
for O

the O

though O

the O

adding O

300,000 O

fanning O
fears O
that O

such O

seem O
more O
remote O

responded O
accordingly. O

finished O
mostly O
higher O
on O

further O
reason O
for O

nothing, O

the O

few O
believe O
that O

shrinking O
as O
abruptly O
as O
the O
Labor I-LOCATION

might O

is O
nothing O
to O

said O
Bruce O
Steinberg O

Merrill I-LOCATION
Lynch I-LOCATION
. O

as O
El O
Nino O
and O
unseasonably O
warm O

in O
January O

exaggerated O
the O
job O
market's O
strength O
in O
the O
winter, O
the O
unseasonable O
cold O
in O
some O
of O
March O
is O
probably O
exaggerating O

numbers O
of O

laid O

Dr. O
Abraham O
said. O

the O
recent O
winter, O
however, O
fewer O

than O
normal O
were O
laid O
off. O

so O
many O
construction O
jobs O
already O
filled, O
early-spring O
hiring O
fell O
short O
of O
its O
usual O
pace. O

growth O
averaged O
205,000 O
a O

is O
not O
as O
strong O
as O
the O
356,000 O
rate O
of O
the O
last O
quarter O
of O
1997, O
but O
it O
is O
robust O
by O
any O
measure. O

still O
probably O
growing O
above O
trend, O
said O
President O
Clinton O

chief O

Janet O
L. O

. O

most O
private O

she O
said, O
the O
Council I-LOCATION

expects O
job O

to O
be O
more O
moderate O
than O
last O

we O
go O
toward O
the O
end O
of O
the O

we'll O
be O
looking O
at O

gotten O
a O
little O
spoiled. O

pace O
of O
125,000 O

so O
a O

apart. O

Indian O

called O
in O
for O

to O
guide O
the O

chief O
designer, O
Douglas O
Cardinal O
, O
is O
of O
Blackfoot O
ancestry. O

soon O
he O
began O
to O
fashion O
a O
dramatic, O
swooping O
building O
of O
rough-hewn O
limestone, O
meant O
to O
resemble O
cliffs O
carved O

with O
windows O
aligned O
so O
that O
at O
winter O

would O
shoot O
in O

sitting O
next O
to O
the O
Capitol O
, O
would O
be O
a O
symbol O
of O
forgiveness O
and O
healing, O
he O
said. O

in O
what O
it O
called O
a O
drastic O
action, O
the O
Smithsonian I-LOCATION

has O
terminated O
its O

prominent O
64-year-old O
Canadian, O

with O
his O

adding O
a O
serious O

to O
the O

termination, O
first O
reported O
this O
week O
by O
The I-LOCATION
Washington I-LOCATION
Post I-LOCATION
, O
has O
come O
after O
a O
protracted O
period O
of O
wrangling O
between O
the O
architect, O
who O
considers O
himself O
a O
warrior, O
and O
the O
museum O
over O
delays O
and O
contractual O
disagreements. O

year, O
saying O
he O
had O
run O
out O
of O
resources O
because O
of O
the O
extra O
hours O
he O
was O
putting O
in, O
Cardinal O
decided O
to O
make O
a O
stand, O
as O
he O
put O
it, O
by O
withholding O
his O
architectural O
drawings, O
in O
effect O
holding O
the O
project O
hostage. O

to O
deliver O
the O
working O
and O
technical O
drawings, O
as O
well O
as O
procedural O
delays O
between O
the O
two O
firms, O
were O
major O
reasons O
for O
the O
dismissal, O
Smithsonian I-LOCATION
officials O
said. O

a O
step O
we've O
taken O
with O
the O
greatest O
reluctance, O
said O
David O
Umansky O
, O
a O
spokesman O
for O
the O
Smithsonian I-LOCATION

, O
which O
had O
planned O
to O
break O
ground O
on O
the O
250,000-square-foot O
project O
in O
the O
fall. O

Cardinal O
did O
not O
live O
up O
to O
the O
contract. O

came O
to O
the O
difficult O
decision O
that O
we O
had O
to O
move O
on O
if O
this O
building O
was O
going O
to O
open O
in O
the O
year O
2002. O

have O
an O
obligation O
to O
produce O
the O
museum O
with O
the O
money O
we O
have. O

Smithsonian I-LOCATION
, O
he O
added, O
relies O
on O
congressional O
appropriations. O

Congress I-LOCATION
looks O
very O
carefully O
on O
how O

is O
being O
spent. O

said O
the O

it O
is O
our O
absolute O
intention O
to O

to O
give O
him O
credit O
for O
it, O
with O

dismissal, O
however, O
has O
angered O
some O
of O
the O
American O

taken O

in O

The O

has O
taken O
the O

to O
confer O

the O
way, O
he O
said. O

have O
a O
fantastic O

produced O
by O
a O

American. O

have O
no O
ethical O
right O
to O
take O
a O
man's O
design, O
whether O
he's O
Indian O
or O
Chinese. O

like O
letting O
someone O
finish O
your O

don't O
they O
recognize O
the O
importance O
of O
allowing O
him O
to O
carry O
forth O

has O
been O
some O

that O

which O

denied. O

he O

his O

current O
dispute O
unfolded O
last O

when O
Cardinal O
asked O
the O
Smithsonian I-LOCATION
for O
additional O

for O
work O
beyond O
the O

to O

they O
would O
make O
those O
provisions, O
he O
said. O

museum O
advanced O
him O
$150,000, O
but O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
year, O
he O
said, O
he O
was O
$300,000 O
in O
the O
hole. O

was O
at O
that O
point, O
he O
said, O
that O
some O
of O
the O
elders O
advised O
him O
to O
hold O
his O
drawings O
until O
the O
problem O
was O
resolved. O

a O
gift O
from O
an O
anonymous O
donor, O
he O
said, O
he O
continued O
the O
work O
after O
he O
was O
dismissed O
because O
he O
wanted O
to O
get O
the O
project O
back O
on O
track. O
Cardinal O
is O
no O
stranger O
to O
controversy. O

the O
early O
1980s O
he O
made O
headlines O
in O
Canada I-LOCATION
when O
he O
suggested O
that, O
rather O
than O
compromise O
his O
design O
for O
the O
Museum I-LOCATION

Canadian I-LOCATION

, O
they O
bulldoze O
it O
back O

a O
park. O

did O
not, O
and O
it O
opened O
to O
great O
fanfare. O

architectural O
historian O
Trevor O
Boddy O
has O
written O
that O
the O
unusual O
cast O
of O
Cardinal O
's O
designs, O
which O
have O
generally O
been O
situated O
in O
remote O
places, O
coupled O
with O
a O
cultivated O
outsider O
persona, O
tended O
to O
keep O
him O
off O
the O
architectural O
A-lists. O
Douglas O
Cardinal O
is O
a O
survivor, O
Boddy O
said O
in O
a O
telephone O
interview, O
and O
he O
tends O
to O
be O
routinely O
underestimated. O

single O
project O
he's O
done O
has O
had O
a O
crisis O
like O
this. O

a O
very O
complex O
person. O
Cardinal O
himself, O
as O
is O
his O
wont, O
is O
trying O
to O
take O
the O
long O
view. O

elders O
have O
guided O
me, O
said O
the O
architect, O
who O
relies O
heavily O
on O
state-of-the-art O
computer O
technology O
to O
execute O
his O
voluptuous O
forms. O

want O
to O
be O
sure O
the O
whole O
building O
is O
done O
with O
honor, O
that O
it O
be O
a O
strong O
expression O
of O
their O
voice. O

the O
only O
way O
the O

will O
have O

that O

at O

Friday O
about O

Starr O

in O

in O
1991 O
_ O

denied. O
Starr O
has O
said O
that O
his O

go O
on, O
regardless O
of O
the O

of O

are O
separate O

although O
it O
has O
often O
been O
difficult O
to O
tell O
how O
separate. O
Starr O

a O
rare O
move, O
Wright O
himself O
designed O
an O
addition O
to O
the O

in O
1945 O
when O
their O
family O
of O
four O

outgrown O

only O
pre-World O

by O

showed O
the O
house O
to O
people O
from O
the O
very O
beginning, O
because O
people O
just O
asked O
out O
of O
curiosity, O
Mildred O
Rosenbaum O
recalled. O

was O
unlike O
anything O
this O
area O
had O
ever O
seen. O

couldn't O
imagine O
what O
was O
behind O
that O
blank O
wall O
in O

either O
rang O
the O
bell O
or O
knocked O
on O
the O
door O
and O
asked, O
`May O
we O
come O
in O
and O
see?' O
We O
allowed O
them O
to O
for O
years. O

after O
Stanley O
passed O
away, O
I O
just O
didn't O
feel O
up O
to O
it. O

than O

that O
in O

the O

to O

the O

developed O
in O
conjunction O
with O
a O
broad-based O
community O

focusing O
on O
the O
benefits O
of O

say O
the O
restoration O
of O
the O
Rosenbaum O
house O
will O
be O
accompanied O
by O
the O
development O
of O
educational O
and O
cultural-outreach O
programs. O

January, O
Mildred O

Alvin O

discussed O
the O

that O
time, O
Alvin O
Rosenbaum O
has O
been O
engaged O
in O
assembling O
a O
planning O
team O
and O
soliciting O
support O
for O
the O
project O
from O
potential O
funding O
sources O
across O
the O
country. O

I've O
had O
substantial O
expressions O
of O
interest O
and O
some O
very O
good O
responses, O
he O
said. O

I O
think O
that O
there O
is O
a O
truism O
that O
national O
foundations O
and O
funding O
sources O
are O
only O
available O
to O
the O
extent O
that O
there O
is O
local O
commitment. O

days, O
public-sector O
support O
is O
not O
as O
important O
as O
individual O
people. O

the O
issue O
is O
not O
just O
financial. O

involves O
partnerships O
and O
cooperative O
relationships O
with O
other O
organizations, O
so O
that O
we're O
not O
duplicating O
efforts O
that O
are O
already O
being O
done. O

his O

just O

he's O

the O

came O
predisposed O
to O
the O
proposition O
that O
the O

be O
preserved, O
admitted O
Walter O

who O
now O
heads O
the O

that O

a O

that O
I've O
been O
here, O
what's O
interesting O
to O
me O
is O
the O
actual O
context O
_ O
the O
way O
this O
house O
and O
this O
family O
fit O
into O
the O
history O
of O
this O

so O
much O
here O
_ O
from O
the O
TVA I-LOCATION
story O
to O
the O
music O
industry O
_ O
and O
it's O
a O
very O
interesting O
mix. O

suspect O
that O
the O
restoration O
of O
this O
house O
will O
have O
a O
catalytic O
effect O
on O
the O
understanding O
of O
the O
Muscle I-LOCATION
Shoals I-LOCATION
area O
and O
how O
it O
presents O
itself O
to O
the O
larger O
public. O

a O
personal O
level, O
Alvin O
Rosenbaum O
wants O
the O
restoration O
of O
the O
house O
to O
continue O
a O
long-standing O
family O
tradition O
of O
building O
the O
character O
of O
this O
community. O

grandfather, O
Louis O
Rosenbaum O
, O
introduced O

to O
the O

helped O
support O

from O

Stanley O
Rosenbaum O

retired O
from O

an O

and O
as O
anyone O
who's O
visited O
here O
can O
tell O
you, O
books O
practically O
hold O
the O

up, O
Rosenbaum O
observed. O

house O
was O
full O
of O
college O

other O
friends O
talking O
about O

enjoying O
an O
intellectual O
atmosphere O
and O
participating O
in O
a O
certain O
quality O
that O
this O
house O
eked O
out O
of O
people. O

to O
me, O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
legacy. O
Rosenbaum O
also O
considers O
the O
restoration O
project O
a O
tribute O
to O
the O
spirit O
and O
dedication O
of O
his O
mother, O
who O
turned O
80 O

and O
continues O
to O

Judge O
Kevin O

of O

rejected O
Ismoil O

contention O
that O
he O

as O
well O
as O
his O

that O

you O

to O

you O
sought O

do O

to O
kill O

judge O
also O
imposed O
a O
$250,000 O
fine, O
and O
ordered O
Ismoil O
to O
pay O
$10 O

in O
restitution O
_ O
just O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
you O
never O

the O

Ismoil O

the O
last O
of O
six O

out O

continued O
to O
assert O
his O
innocence. O

me, O
and O
you O
will O
add O
one O
number O
to O
the O
wrong O
list, O
he O
said. O

don't O
think O
that O
you O
will O
ever O
rest, O
because O
tyrants O
always O
end O
up O
in O
trouble. O

said O
that O
the O
charges O
were O
false O
and O
that O
they O
would O
fade O
like O
a O
bubble. O

this O
world, O
he O
said, O
a O
fair O
trial O
is O
always O
rare. O

judge O
dismissed O
his O
contention. O

have O
received O
an O
extraordinarily O
fair O
trial, O
something O
which O
was O
done O
not O
as O
a O
show O
trial O
but O
to O
give O
you O
the O
opportunity O
to O
put O
forward O
whatever O
you O
wanted O
to O
do, O
he O
said. O

the O
rules O
of O
the O
federal O
system, O
Ismoil O
will O
not O
be O
eligible O
for O
parole, O
and O
is O
likely O
to O
spend O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
life O
in O
prison. O

sentence O
matches O
the O
240-year-terms O
imposed O
on O
the O
five O
other O
men O
convicted O
in O
the O

U.S. I-LOCATION
attorney O
in O

, O
Mary O
Jo O

, O
whose O

said O

Ismoil O
did O
not O
testify O
in O
the O
trial, O
but O
his O
lawyer, O
Louis O
R. O

, O
often O
sought O
to O
distance O
his O
client O
from O
Yousef O
, O
portraying O
him O
as O
a O
naive O
21-year-old O
Jordanian O
who O
came O
to O
the O
United I-LOCATION
States I-LOCATION
to O
get O
an O

and O
a O
job, O
and O
got O
swept O
into O
the O
conspiracy. O

said O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
that O
Ismoil O
was O
a O
religious O
or O
political O
fanatic, O
like O
Yousef O
. O

said O
Ismoil O
was O
working O
in O
Texas I-LOCATION
when O
he O
was O
called O
by O
Yousef O
and O
asked O
to O
help O
in O
the O
plot. O
Ismoil O
told O
authorities O
after O
his O
arrest O
that O
he O
believed O
he O
was O
transporting O
boxes O
of O
soap O
into O
the O
World O
Trade O
Center O
garage O
as O
part O
of O
a O
business O
deal, O
the O
jury O
was O
told. O

Friday's O
proceeding, O
Aidala O
again O
questioned O
whether O
there O
was O
sufficient O
evidence O
that O
Ismoil O
knew O
he O
was O
participating O
in O
a O
bombing. O

U.S. I-LOCATION
Attorney O
David O
Kelley O
argued O
that O
the O
jury O
had O
made O
fair O
conclusions O
from O
the O
circumstantial O
evidence. O

judge O
agreed O
and O
then O
echoed O
statements O
that O
he O
had O
made O
in O
sentencing O
Yousef O
in O
January, O
when O
he O
said O
that O
the O
convicted O
terrorist O
had O
worshiped O
the O
god O
of O
death O
and O
destruction. O

were O
like O
Ramzi O
Yousef O
because O
your O
god O
was O
evil, O
the O
judge O
told O
Ismoil O
on O
Friday. O

am O
not O
talking O
about O
an O
evil O
god; O
I O
am O
talking O
about O
the O

up O
and O

around O

know O
about O
the O

he O
asked, O
holding O
out O
a O
flier O
plucked O
from O
the O

it O
was O

of O

Foner O
, O
82, O
may O
not O
be O
able O
to O
do O
much O
marching O
these O
days, O
but O
he O
does O
what O
he O
can O
to O
fulfill O
the O
last O
half O
of O
that O
declaration. O

decades O
he O
was O
second O
in O
command O
at O
1199 I-LOCATION
, O
the O
hospital O
workers O
union, O
witnessing O
a O
tumultuous O
era O
when O
it O
went O
from O
representing O
drugstore O
clerks O
and O
pharmacists O
to O
winning O
collective O
bargaining O
rights O
for O
thousands O
of O
low-paid, O
behind-the-scenes O
workers O
at O
nonprofit O
hospitals. O

those O
rocky O
times, O
King O
was O
a O
steadfast O
supporter O
of O
what O
he O
called O
his O
favorite O
union O
and O
the O
moral O
conscience O
of O
the O
labor O
movement. O

30 O
years O
after O
King O
was O
assassinated O
in O
Memphis I-LOCATION
, O
Tenn. I-LOCATION
, O
people O
may O
recall O
what O
the O
civil-rights O
leader O
did O
for O
the O
cause O
of O
racial O
equality. O

people O
like O
Foner O
will O
never O
forget O
what O
he O
did O
for O
organized O
labor, O
a O
struggle O
that O
King O
cast O
in O
terms O
of O
human O
rights O
and O
dignity. O

people O
know O
very O
little O
about O
Dr. O
King O
, O
said O
Foner O
, O
who O
directs O
the O
union's O
Bread O
and O
Roses O
project, O
which O
takes O
culture O
to O
the O
work O
place. O
King O
was O
involved O
with O
many O
unions. O

he O
was O
shot O
down O
in O
Memphis I-LOCATION
, O
he O
was O
supporting O
the O
sanitation O
workers, O
who O
were O
on O
strike. O

his O
association O
with O
us O
was O
special. O

the O
two O
men O
met O
in O
1959, O
the O
union O
was O
trying O
to O
organize O
in O
seven O
hospitals, O
despite O
the O
obstacles O
posed O
by O
reluctant O
managers O
and O
laws O
that O
excluded O
employees O
of O
nonprofit O
hospitals O
from O
labor O
laws. O

were O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
ladder, O
Foner O
recalled. O

received O
$26 O
a O
week O
and O
had O
no O
protection. O

said O
to O
us: O
Don't O
touch O
the O
hospitals. O

workers O
won't O
stick O
together O
because O
they're O
poor. O

assuming O
you O
get O
a O
majority, O
the O
hospitals O
don't O
have O
to O
agree O
to O
an O
election. O

if O
you O
go O
on O
strike, O
all O
you'll O
get O
is O
injunctions, O
jailings O
and O
fines. O

the O
hospital O
workers O
were O
receptive O
to O
the O
union's O
overtures, O
Foner O
and O
his O
colleagues O
decided O
they O
needed O
to O
open O
another O
front O
in O
their O
campaign. O

suspected O
that O
organizing O
low-paid O
minority O
workers O
would O
not O
be O
enough O
to O
sway O
the O
boards O
that O
ran O
the O
institutions. O

had O
to O
get O
the O
public's O
support, O
so O
that O
could O
have O
a O
moral O
effect O
on O
management, O
he O
said. O

dealing O
with O
trustees O
of O
hospitals O
that O
can O
call O
up O
and O
speak O
to O
the O
mayor O
and O
governor. O

Who's O
Who O
of O
America I-LOCATION
, O
those O
people. O
King O
knew O
about O
the O
union, O
and O
Foner O
was O
invited O
to O
meet O
with O
him O
at O
the O
home O
of O
Stanley O
Levison O
, O
a O
New I-LOCATION
York I-LOCATION
businessman O
who O
was O
a O
close O
adviser O
to O
King O
. O

that O
meeting, O
King O
offered O
to O
write O
a O
letter O
of O
support O
which O
the O
union O
widely O
circulated. O

1962, O
when O
the O
union O
was O
lobbying O
to O
amend O
state O
laws O
to O
allow O
collective O
bargaining O
for O
hospital O
workers, O
King O
called O
Gov. O
Nelson O
Rockefeller O
three O
times O
to O
urge O
his O
support. O
King O
often O
visited O
with O
union O
members O
and O
officials, O
and O
his O
last O
major O
speech O
in O
New I-LOCATION
York I-LOCATION
City I-LOCATION
was O
at O
a O
union O
rally O
the O
month O
before O
he O
was O
killed. O

it, O
he O
boasted O
that O
he O
considered O
himself O
a O
fellow O
1199 I-LOCATION
-er. O

mentioned O
that O
any O
talk O
of O
urban O
unrest O
and O
long, O
hot O
summers, O
should O
also O
consider O
what O
was O
done O
during O
the O
long, O
cold O
winters O
that O
preceded O
them. O

talked O
about O
how O
people O
worked O
full-time O
jobs O
for O
part-time O
pay. O

are O
always O
talking O
about O
menial O
labor, O
he O
told O
the O
audience. O

no O
labor O
is O
really O
menial O
unless O
you're O
not O
getting O
adequate O
wages. O

and O
a O
half O
weeks O
later, O
he O
was O
dead. O

union O
he O
helped O
is O
now O
the O
city's O
largest, O
and O
its O
headquarters O
bears O
his O
name. O

that O
Foner O
needs O
any O
reminders. O

be O
at O
Saturday's O
rally, O
even O
if O
walking O
a O
block O
leaves O
him O
short O
of O

has O
to O
show O
it's O
really O
interested O

CHILDS O

WARD O
STRUGGLING O
AT O
WORST O
POSSIBLE O
TIME O
NEW I-LOCATION
YORK I-LOCATION
_ O
It O
was O
easier O
for O
Chris O
Childs O
to O
be O
with O
the O
Nets I-LOCATION
two O
years O
ago. O

pressure, O
no O
hype. O

freedom O
from O
expectation O
meant O
wowing O
everyone O
as O
a O
playmaking O
guard O
with O
a O
freewheeling O
style. O

lost O
his O
anonymity O
that O
summer O
when O
he O
signed O
a O
$24 O
million O
deal O
with O
the O
Knicks I-LOCATION
. O

went O
just O
across O
the O
river, O
but O
to O
another O
world, O
as O
a O
high-profile O
point O
guard. O

has O
been O
adjusting O
ever O
since. O

injury-riddled O
season, O
in O
which O
he O
went O
from O
starter O
to O
backup, O
has O
been O
particularly O
difficult O
and O
increasingly O
dreadful O
for O
Childs O
. O

his O
last O
three O
games, O
Childs O
has O
made O
four O
of O
17 O
shots O
and O
committed O
seven O
turnovers O
in O
68 O
minutes O
of O
playing O
time. O

not O
happy O
with O
the O
way O
I'm O
playing, O
Childs O
said O
after O
an O
0-for-2, O
three-turnover O
performance O
against O
the O
Los I-LOCATION
Angeles I-LOCATION
Clippers I-LOCATION
on O
Thursday O
night. O

not O
getting O
the O
ball O
to O
the O
basket. O

leg O
is O
not O
hurting O
as O
much O
as O
it O
did O
before, O
so O
I've O
got O
to O
get O
there. O

going O
to O
play O
my O
game O
on O
Saturday. O

he O
does, O
his O
return O
to O
the O
Childs O
of O
old O
will O
take O
place O
Saturday O
night O
at O
Continental O
Arena, O
where O
he O
was O
so O
comfortable O
with O
the O
Nets I-LOCATION
. O

much O
as O
Childs O
has O
struggled O
as O
a O
Knick I-LOCATION
_ O
not O
clicking O
with O
either O
the O
Patrick O
Ewing O
-oriented O
offense O
or O
the O
current O
one O
without O
the O
injured O
center O
_ O
he O
is O
only O
half O
of O
the O
point O
guard O
problem. O
Charlie O
Ward O
, O
the O
starter, O
has O
also O
hit O
a O
season-low O
lull. O

times, O
he O
has O
been O
clutch O
in O
his O
shots O
and O
smart O
in O
his O
passes O
off O
penetration. O

over O
the O
same O
three O
games O
that O
Childs O
' O
game O
has O
worsened, O
Ward O
's O
shooting O
has O
been O
worse. O

has O
made O
one O
of O
15 O
shots O
and O
is O
0 O
for O
5 O
from O
3-point O
range. O

not O
really O
worried O
about O
their O
scoring, O
Knicks I-LOCATION
coach O
Jeff O
Van O
Gundy O
said. O
Charlie O
is O
aggressive O
and O
looks O
for O
other O
guys. O

just O
want O
to O
make O
sure O
he O
maintains O
the O
right O
balance O
and O
takes O
his O
own O
shot O
when O
he's O
open. O
Chris O
has O
got O
to O
play O
through O
it O
and O
keep O
working. O

means O
doing O
the O
extra O
shooting O
Van O
Gundy O
has O
been O
banging O
the O
drum O
for O
lately. O

a O
team, O
particularly O
in O
the O
backcourt O
over O
the O
last O
week, O
the O
Knick I-LOCATION
players' O
shots O
have O
fallen O
hard O
on O
the O
rim. O

is O
not O
the O
time O
for O
an O
offensive O
swoon, O
not O
when O
the O
Knicks I-LOCATION
are O
trying O
to O
hold O
fast O
to O
a O

like O
the O

we O
were O
in O

said O
Van O
Gundy O
, O
whose O
team O
held O
a O
three-and-a-half-game O
lead O
over O
the O
Nets I-LOCATION
. O

were O
always O
the O
underdog. O

think O
that's O
all O
changed. O

much O
has O
changed O
since O
Childs O
was O
with O
the O
Nets I-LOCATION
. O

the O
Knicks I-LOCATION
, O
it O
is O
not O
so O
easy O
to O
be O
himself. O

was O
brought O
here O
for O
other O
aspects O
of O
my O
game; O
I've O
got O
to O
show O
that, O
said O
Childs O
, O
who O
admits O
the O
ankle O
that O
he O
sprained O
six O
weeks O

is O
not O
what O
is O

him O
now. O

not O

is O

Patrick O

at O

and O
ran O
through O
some O

Thursday O

that O
Ewing O
is O
expected O

within O
10 O
days, O
the O
final O
step O
for O
a O

expect O
he'll O
practice O
before O
the O
end O
of O
the O

at O
some O
point, O
Jeff O
Van O
Gundy O
said O
Friday O
before O
describing O
Ewing O

we O
went O
contact, O
he O
didn't O
play. O

he's O
able O
to, O
contact O
would O
be O
the O
next O
step. O

would O
be O
a O
huge O
step. O

a O
setback O

Ewing O
could O

they O
played O
miserably, O

more O
mistakes O
in O

than O
in O
the O
final O
two O
weeks O
of O

the O
first O
inning, O

singled O

I O

Jeter O

Edmonds O
caught O
it O
like O

Anaheim I-LOCATION
scored O
three O
runs O
in O
the O
fourth O

against O
David O

if O

up O
the O

chances O
of O
an O
inning-ending O
double O

were O
marginal, O
but O
any O
shot O
was O
lost O
when O
Jeter O
fumbled O
the O
bouncer O
and O
settled O
for O
the O
out O
at O
first. O

of O
being O
out O

the O
inning, O
Wells O
had O
to O

on O
and O
two O
out, O

of O
Anderson O

ball. O

hit O
it O
slow. O

Wells O
accepted O
his O
share O
of O
the O
blame O
for O
the O
three O
runs; O
he O
threw O
a O
fastball O
with O
no O
balls O
and O
two O
strikes O
to O
Hollins O
for O
the O
home O
run O
and O
a O
hanging O
curveball O
for O
Nevin O
's O
double. O
Darryl O
Strawberry O

between O
them. O

occurred O
twice O
Thursday, O
with O
Strawberry O
catching O
the O

and O
dropping O
the O

as O
he O

Scott O
Brosius O
, O
the O

fielded O
a O
grounder O
with O

at O

and O
the O
infield O
in. O
Brosius O
glanced O
at O
Carlos O
Garcia O
, O
the O
runner O
at O
third, O
before O
looking O
to O
second; O
Brosius O
had O
forgotten O
that O

Chuck O

would O
not O
be O
covering O
the O
base O
with O
the O
infield O
in. O

Brosius O
quickly O
threw O
to O
first. O

noted O
Brosius O
' O

and O
scored. O

the O
infielders O
reset O
for O
the O
next O
hitter, O
Brosius O
tapped O
his O
chest, O
acknowledging O
his O
mistake. O

Strawberry O
overthrew O
a O
cutoff O
man. O

we O

all O
the O
