Borrowers

Moody's
did
not
change
any

but
the
negative
outlook
may
lead
to
a
formal

in
18

could
raise
borrowing
costs
for
all
Japanese,
from

to
large

even
those
with

such
a
move
could
further
weaken
Japanese
banks,
which
already
pay
more
to
borrow
because
they
hold
in
excess
of
$600

Moody's
was
a

because
even
with

it

DRUG
FOR
IMPOTENCE
RAISES
HOPE
FOR
ITS
USE
BY
WOMEN,
TOO
The
buzz
over
the
new
impotence
drug,
Viagra,
has
prompted
many
women
and
researchers
to
wonder
whether
it
could
improve
the
sex
lives
of
women
if
they
took
it
as
well.

in
the
process,
it
is
generating
new
interest
in
sex
research
in
general
and
women's
sexual
problems
in
particular.

decades,
the
field
of
sex
research
has
been
a
scientific
backwater,
researchers
acknowledge.

federal
government
kept
away
from
sex
research
and
serious
investigators
considered
it
career
suicide
to
go
into
an
area
that
lacked
federal
financing
and
evoked
snickers
from
other
researchers.

Viagra
was
discovered
by
accident.

Pfizer
,
its
maker,
was
looking
for
a
drug
to
relieve
the
chest
pain
of
heart
disease.

compound,
sildenafil
citrate
in
pill
form,
did
not
work
as
intended,
but
it
had
an
unexpected
side
effect:
some
men
taking
Viagra
found
that
it
resulted
in
prolonged
or
enhanced
erections.

Pfizer
scientists
decided
to
investigate
its
usefulness
as
an
impotence
remedy,
they
had
to
learn
about
the
biochemistry
and
neurobiology
of
erections.

also
had
to
pay
for
developing
a
survey
to
determine
whether
erections,
sexual
performance
and
sexual
desire
improved
and,
if
so,
by
how
much.

many
doctors
want
to
know
whether
Viagra
works
on
women,
since
the
clitoris
is
the
female
version
of
the
penis
and
thus
becomes
engorged
with
blood
during
sexual
arousal.

how,
they
ask,
should
they
measure
arousal
in
women,
especially
since
relatively
little
is
known
about
sexual
function
and
dysfunction
among
women?
Until
researchers
solve
that
problem,
Pfizer
's
plans
to
test
the
effects
of
Viagra
on
women
cannot
begin.

the
meantime,
researchers
say,
women
have
been
calling
them
and
asking
about
the
pill.

even
asking
about
whether
Viagra
works
for
women
has
meant
starting
the
sort
of
sex
research
that
has
been
stymied,
experts
said.

at
the
Robert
Wood
Johnson
Medical
School
in
New
Brunswick
,
N.J.
While
some
welcome
the
change,
others
ask
how
money
and
attention
from
drug
companies
will
alter
a
field
that
has
focused
as
much
on
feelings
and
relationships
as
it
has
on

it

said
Dr.
Leonore
Tiefer
,
a
sex
researcher
and
clinical
professor
of

at

Center
.

I
think
of
an

as
a
means
to

Tiefer
said,
something
suitable
to
a
couple
rather
than
something
you
measure
in
the
guy
in
the
lab.

researchers
wonder
whether
it
will
be
good
or
bad
for
relationships

a
new
generation
of
drugs

people
who

said
Dr.
Pepper
Schwartz
,
a

University
of

think
in

that
if
a

true.

say
that
the
anticipated

is
long

for

argue
that
as
a
society
sexual
functioning
shouldn't
have
the
image
it
has,

Rosen
.

sexual

for
the
people
involved,
it
can
be
devastating,
he
said.

anything,
he
added,
sexual
problems
are
more
common
in
women
than
in
men
and,
as
in
men,
they
are
more
common
as
people
get
older.

women,
a
major
issue
is
lack
of
desire.

Rosen
said
much
remained
unknown:
What
is
the
relationship
between
lack
of
desire
and
measures
of
sexual
performance
_
lubrication
and
arousal?
Is
it
that
women
lose
desire
and
then
develop
arousal
difficulties
or
is
it
the
other
way
around?
Women
may
complain
of
a
lack
of
desire
because
it
is
more
acceptable
for
them
to
say
that
than
to
say
they
have
difficulty
becoming
aroused,
Dr.
Rosen
said.

55-year-old
nurse
at
the
University
of
Maryland
said
she
could
not
decide
whether
her
problem
was
lack
of
desire
or
lack
of
an
ability
to
become
aroused.

you're
younger,
you
could
look
at
someone
and
all
those
bells
and
whistles
would
go
off,
the
nurse
said,
speaking
on
the
condition
of
anonymity.

when
you
are
with
your
partner
for
a
long
time,
she
added,
a
certain
boredom
sets
in.

maybe
Viagra
could
be
the
answer
to
that,
she
said.

she,
and
virtually
every
woman
she
knew,
would
like
to

least
one
researcher,
Dr.
Irwin
Goldstein
,
a
professor
of
urology
at
the
Boston
University
School
of
Medicine
,
said
his
research
indicated
that
the
problem
for
middle-aged
women
was
the
same
as
it
was
for
middle-aged
men:
a
paucity
of
blood
flowing
to
the
sex
organs.

if
Goldstein
is
correct,
it
makes
at
least
theoretical
sense
that
Viagra
be
helpful
for
women.

was
Goldstein
whose
survey
of
Massachusetts
men
indicated
that
about
half
of
all
men
aged
40
to
70
had
difficulties
obtaining
or
maintaining
erections.

also
discovered
that
the
problem
was
most
common
among
men
with
conditions
that
can
lead
to
vascular
problems
that
can
lead
to
diminished
flow
in
blood
vessels,
like
diabetes.

Goldstein
and
his
colleagues
are
extending
their
research
to
women.

get
an
idea
of
how
common
sexual
problems
are
in
women,
Goldstein
surveyed
300
women
whose
partners
had
consulted
him
about
impotency.

sexual
dysfunction
as
discomfort
during
sexual
intercourse,
dryness,
increased
time
for
arousal,
diminished
ability
to
reach
orgasm,
or
diminished
clitoral
sensation,
Goldstein
found
that
58
percent
of
the
women
were
affected.

as
like
men,
the
women
were
more
likely
to
have
sexual
difficulties
if
they
were
older
and
if
they
had
medical
conditions
relating
to
vascular
problems.
Goldstein
and
Dr.
Jennifer
Berman
,
a
urologist
at
the
University
of
Maryland
in
Baltimore
,
also
examined
the
blood
vessels
that
supplied
the
clitorises
of
cadavers
and
those
of
women
undergoing
X-ray
examinations
of
the
arteries
for
vascular
disease.

found
that
just
as
disease
and
aging
cause
blood
vessels
to
narrow
in
other
parts
of
the
body,
the
sexual
organs
were
similarly
affected,
Goldstein
said.

field

now,
he
said.

Goldstein
said,
is
no
longer
mostly
a
psychosomatic
complaint,
it
is
not
something
to
be
resolved
only
through
years
of
therapy,
and
it
is
not
a
problem
for
a
urologist
alone.

he
said,
sexual
dysfunction
is
in
essence
a
vascular
disease.

is,
he
said,
a
heart
attack
of
the

a
heart
attack

CLINTON
TAKES
ON
GOP
SENATORS,
BIG
TOBACCO
WASHINGTON
_
Eager
to
shift
the
spotlight
from
Paula
Jones
back
to
the
business
of
government,
President
Clinton
lambasted
the
Republican
Senate
budget
proposal
on
Friday
and
warned
tobacco
companies
to
go
along
with
a
proposed
settlement.

but
buoyant
in
his
first
day
back
at
the
Oval
Office
after
12
days
in
Africa
,
Clinton
immediately
assembled
his
economic
team
in
the
White
House
Rose
Garden
this
morning
and
signaled
an
election-year
showdown
with
congressional
Republicans
over
the
budget
for
the
1999
fiscal
year.

clearly
emboldened
by
a
federal
judge's
dismissal
on
Wednesday
of
Mrs.
Jones
'
sexual
misconduct
lawsuit,
the
president
vowed
not
to
be
distracted
by
such
matters,
saying,
I
am
going
on
with
my
business.

Clinton
castigated
Senate
Republicans
for
approving
a
$1.73
trillion
spending
plan
on
Thursday
night
that
calls
for
modest
tax
cuts
and
excludes
virtually
all
of
the
president's
proposals
for
new
spending.

he
scolded
members
of
the
House
for
passing
a
six-year,
$217
billion
transportation
bill
packed
with
projects
for
almost
every
congressional
district.

am
very
concerned
that
the
budget
plan
now
working
its
way
through
the
Senate
will
squeeze
out
critical
investments
in
education
and
children,
Clinton
said.

also
determined
that
highway
spending,
though
it
is
quite
important
and
though
our
budget
provides
for
a
very
impressive
increase
in
investment
in
highways
and
mass
transit,
must
be
within
the
balanced
budget
and
not
crowd
out
critical
investments
in
education,
child
care,
health
care
or
threaten
our
budget
discipline.

Trent
Lott
,
R-
Miss.
,
the
majority
leader,
dismissed
the
president's
comments,
asserting:
We
have
our
priorities,
he
has
his
priorities.

is
a
high
priority
for
us.

that
it
was
Republicans
,
not
Clinton
,
who
sought
more
money
for
education
training,
Lott
said,
He
needs
to
check
his
figures
before
he
starts
complaining.

from
one
domestic
priority
to
another,
the
president
called
on
tobacco
companies
to
go
along
with
the
bill
that
was
approved
this
week
by
the
Senate
Commerce
Committee
,
even
though
it
was
tougher
on
the
companies
than
the
proposed
settlement
they
agreed
to
last
summer.

am
determined
to
seize
this
historic
opportunity
to
pass
bipartisan
legislation
to
protect
our
children
from
the
dangers
of
tobacco,
he
said.

Congress
can
be
the
Congress
that
saves
millions
of
children's
lives.

cigarette
companies,
Clinton
said,
needed
to
reverse
the
record
of
the
past,
to
try
to
put
this
unforgivable
chapter
behind
them.
Lott
,
meanwhile,
said
that
if
the
tobacco
settlement
did
not
reach
the
Senate
floor
by
June
1,
it's
going
to
be
pretty
hard
to
bring
it
to
a
vote
this
year.

not
saying
it's
impossible,
the
senator
said.

I
think
that
the
best
time
to
do
it
would
be
before
we
go
out
for
the
Memorial
Day
recess.
Clinton
was
unusually
jaunty
at
his
White
House
homecoming
event.

to
put
the
best
face
on
figures
showing
a
slight
rise
in
unemployment,
which
were
made
public
shortly
before
his
Rose
Garden
appearance,
he
said,
While
there
will
be
ups
and
downs,
our
economy
continues
to
be
one
of
the
strongest
in
history.

CLINTON
SAYS
JAPAN
MUST
CHANGE
ECONOMIC
POLICY
WASHINGTON
_
President
Clinton
warned
in
unusually
explicit
terms
Friday
that
Japan
must
change
course
if
it
hopes
to
pull
its
economy
out
of
a
long-running
decline
that
has
worsened
markedly
in
recent
weeks.

his
comments
as
evidence
mounted
that
Japan
,
already
languishing
in
recession,
is
headed
into
one
of
its
worst
downturns
since
the
end
of
World
War
II,
and
the
yen
fell
to
a
six-and-a-half-year
low
against
the
dollar.

Clinton
issued
his
warning
to
Japan
in
response
to
a
question
at
a
news
conference,
he
was
clearly
ready
to
send
a
strong
message,
saying,
You
simply
can't
stay
with
a
strategy
that
is
clearly
not
appropriate
to
the
times
and
expect
it
to
get
the
results
that
are
needed
for
the
country.

months
U.S.
officials
have
become
increasingly
specific
about
what
they
believe
Japan
must
do,
advocating
huge
tax
cuts
and
old-fashioned
deficit
spending
to
spur
an
economy
that
many
experts
say
could
shrink
by
2
percent
this
year.

careful
to
praise
Japan
's
embattled
prime
minister,
Ryutaro
Hashimoto
,
as
an
able
man,
but
he
said
there
was
clearly
an
ongoing
struggle
with
an
entrenched
bureaucracy.

comments
stepped
up
the
recent
public
pressure
from
Treasury
Secretary
Robert
Rubin
and
leaders
from
several
of
the
world's
biggest
economic
powers,
who
have
said
repeatedly
that
Japan
's
economic
decline
and
its
inability
to
absorb
imports
from
neighboring
countries
threaten
to
undermine
Asia
's
fragile
recovery.
U.S.
officials
have
a
more
specific
concern:
the
risk
that
a
collapse
of
more
major
Japanese
banks
and
securities
dealers
could
imperil
Wall
Street,
just
as
the
Dow

Industrial
Average

is
hardly
a
foregone
conclusion.

U.S.
companies
are
already
reporting
that
their
exports
to
Asia
are
dropping
drastically,
and
a
collapse
in
Japan
,
many
say,
could
start
a
new
round
of
economic
contagion
that
could
reach
further
than
the
crises
in
Southeast
Asia
and
South
Korea

this

looking
at
an
economic
actor,
the
world's
second-largest
economy,
whose
decisions
affect
the
globe,
and
there
is
a
growing
sense
that
they
are
not
up

that
they
do
not
understand
the
gravity
of
the
situation

a
loss
of
confidence.

Thursday
the

Norio
Ohga

a
man
not
given
to
alarmist
statements,
warned
that
Japan
's

is
on
the
verge
of
collapsing.

Prime
Minister
Hashimoto
to
President
Hoover

1929

at
what

But
the
sharp
reactions
in
Japan
's
stock
and
currency
markets
seem
to
have
been
driven
by
two
different
events.

first
was
the
end
of
the
Japanese
fiscal
year
on
Tuesday.

days
before
that
deadline,
the
Japanese
government
was
investing
heavily
in
the
country's
stock
market,
trying
to
boost
the
price
of
stocks
held
by
Japan
's
banks,
which
are
burdened
with
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
of
bad
debts.

goal
was
to
make
year-end
balance
sheets
appear
far
sounder
than
they
really
were,
so
banks
would
meet
international
requirements
for
lending
around
the
world.

the
stock
prices
never
rose
as
far
as
Japanese
officials
had
hoped,
and
as
soon
as
the
deadline
passed,
prices
dropped
steeply.

second
alarm
came
from
Moody's
Investors
Service
,
one
of
the
world's
leading
financial
rating
agencies,
which
issued
an
unusual
warning
about
Japan
on
Friday.

Moody's
did
not
drop
the
Japanese
government's
triple-A
rating,
the
highest
it
grants
to
any
country,
it
altered
its
outlook
to
negative.

there
is
virtually
no
fear
that
Japan
could
default
on
its
government
debt
_
the
country
has
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
in
reserves
_
the
warning
made
investors
who
fear
rising
bankruptcies
extremely
skittish.

United
States
has
been
warning
Japan
to
take
far
stronger
economic
action
for
more
than
18
months
now.

year
ago,
when
Hashimoto
visited
the
White
House
,
he
made
a
detailed
economic
presentation
to
Clinton
,
Vice
President
Al
Gore
and
top
economic
officials,
arguing
that
a
3
percent
tax
increase
that
Japan
was
imposing
would
not
send
the
economy
into
a
tailspin.

was
wrong.

November,
Hashimoto
admitted
that
the
tax
increase,
which
had
been
pressed
by
bureaucrats
in
Japan
's
Finance
Ministry
,
had
been
a
major
mistake.

he
has
not
moved
to
repeal
the
tax,
and
so
far
the
economic
programs
he
has
announced
to
spur
the
economy
have
been
a
murky
mixture
of
new
and
previously
announced
ones.
Japan
's
ambassador
to
Washington
,
Kunihiko
Saito
,
said
Friday
that
he
had
no
problem
with
the
mounting
pressure
from

Switzerland

served
notice
on
Friday
with
unusual
bluntness
that
it
would
fight
a
planned

in
the
United

that
the

Germany
in
the

of
looted
assets,
including
gold,
bonds,
and
securities,
said
Michael
Hausfeld
,
a
Washington
lawyer
representing
Holocaust
victims
and

said
in
a
telephone
interview
on
Friday
that
the
suit
had
been
prepared
but
not
yet
filed
and
did
not
specify
an
amount
for

said
that
despite
the
tough
stand
taken
by
the
Swiss
National

,
preparations
for
the

would
continue,
but
that

had
not

where
in

would
be

the

declared:

not

came
just
eight
days
after
Switzerland
's
big
three
private
banks
agreed
to
negotiate
what
was
termed
a
global
settlement
to
halt
three
separate
class-action
suits

by
Holocaust

stashed
in
Switzerland
during
and
after
World

Werner
Abegg
,
a
Swiss
National

spokesman
in
Zurich
,
said
that
the
statement
on
Friday
had
been
issued
to
make
it
very
clear
that,
even
under
the

the
National

,
as
a
public
body,
cannot
make
an
out-of-court

independent
inquiry
by
Swiss
historians
found
that
the
Swiss
National
Bank
had
bought
some
$389
million
worth
of
gold

wartime
prices
_
from
Nazi
Germany
,
while
a
further
$61
million
was
purchased
through
private
Swiss
banks.

those
figures
would
be
multiplied

ninefold.

Swiss
National
Bank
estimates
its
own
purchases
of
Nazi
gold
at
$280
million,
at
wartime
exchange
rates,
and
acknowledges
that
it
was
the
largest
buyer
of
gold
from
the
German
Reichsbank
.

under
an
agreement
with
the
United
States
and
other
Western
powers
reached
in
1946,
the
Swiss
authorities
agreed
to
pay
back
only
some
$58
million.

the
gold
sold
by
Nazi
Germany

been
under

pressure
to

either
the

or
the
commercial
banks

acknowledged
holding.

Congress
estimates
that
gold
purchased
by
Switzerland
during
the
war
that
had
been
stolen
from

to
Nazi
death
camps,

its
statement
on
Friday,
the
Swiss
National

sought
to
close
off

discussion
of
those
transactions,

were
the
subject
of
a
binding
agreement

If

there
was
no

that

in

she
believed
that
Ms.

adding
that
it
was
unlikely
the

would
be
overturned.

that
the

gave

it
that
much
harder
to

Ms.

experts
said
the
8th

judges
had
created
a
strong
record
in
favor
of
defendants
in
employment

cases,
which
is
Clinton
's
role
in
this
case.

that
this
circuit
has
been
trying
to
cut
back
on
the
ease
with
which
people
can
bring
these
suits,
you
could
say
this
would
be
an
easy
case
to
affirm,
said
Roger
Goldman
,
a
law
professor
at
St.

University
.

if
you
look
at
the
political
side
of
things,
that
would
cut
in
the
other
direction.

all
the
judges
who
are
not
recused
on
this
matter
were
appointed
by
either
Bush
or
Reagan
and
to
the
extent
that
politics
makes
a
difference,
that
would
cut
in
the
other
direction.
Goldman
was
referring
to
the
fact
that
just
three
of
the
10
active
judges
on
the
appeals
court
have
been
appointed
by
Democratic
presidents,
and
two
of
the
three
have
made
it
known
they
would
not
participate
in
any
cases
involving
Clinton
.

similar
view
to
Goldman

was
offered
by
Leland
Ware
of
the
same
law
school
who
has
studied
the
appeals
court's
handling
of
summary
judgments.

been
pretty
rigorous
about
affirming

rulings
in

say
the
restoration
of
the
Rosenbaum
house
will
be
accompanied
by
the
development
of
educational
and
cultural-outreach
programs.

January,
Mildred
and
Alvin
Rosenbaum
discussed
the
future
of
the
house
with
representatives
of
the
Florence
-based
Frank
Lloyd
Wright
Rosenbaum
House
Foundation
as
well
as
local
leaders
in
business,
education,
tourism,
historic
preservation
and
the
arts.

that
time,
Alvin
Rosenbaum
has
been
engaged
in
assembling
a
planning
team
and
soliciting
support
for
the
project
from
potential
funding
sources
across
the
country.

I've
had
substantial
expressions
of
interest
and
some
very
good
responses,
he
said.

I
think
that
there
is
a
truism
that
national
foundations
and
funding
sources
are
only
available
to
the
extent
that
there
is
local
commitment.

days,
public-sector
support
is
not
as
important
as
individual
people.

the
issue
is
not
just
financial.

involves
partnerships
and
cooperative
relationships
with
other
organizations,
so
that
we're
not
duplicating
efforts
that
are
already
being
done.
Alvin
Rosenbaum
believes
his
family's
cherished
home
_
which
celebrates
its
landmark
60th
anniversary
next
year
_
can
be
developed
as
the
hub
for
a
region-wide
heritage
initiative
that
encompasses
all
of
the
cultural
attractions

the
Helen
Keller
birthplace

define

that
I've
been
here,
what's
interesting
to
me
is
the

context

the
way
this

this

fit
into
the
history
of
this

it's

that
the
restoration
of
this
house
will
have
a
catalytic
effect
on
the
understanding
of
the
Muscle
Shoals

and
how
it
presents
itself
to
the
larger
public.

a
personal
level,
Alvin
Rosenbaum
wants
the
restoration
of
the
house
to
continue
a
long-standing
family
tradition
of
building
the
character
of
this
community.

Louis

this

eked
out

to
me,

the
most
important
part
of
the

Rosenbaum
also
considers
the

a
tribute
to
the

and
dedication
of
his

WORLD

GETS
240
YEARS
NEW

_
Eyad
Ismoil
,
the
man
who
drove
a
rental
van
loaded
with
a
homemade
bomb
into
the
World
Trade
Center
garage
in
1993
and
helped
cause
the
explosion
that
killed
six
people
and
injured
hundreds
more,
was
sentenced
on
Friday
to
240
years
in
prison.

handing
down
the
sentence,
Judge
Kevin
T.

of
U.S.
District
Court
in
Manhattan
rejected
Ismoil
's
contention
that
he
had
not
received
a
fair
trial,
as
well
as
his
lawyer's
argument
that
Ismoil
was
not
a
knowing
participant
in
the
bombing
plot
when
he
was
recruited
into
the
conspiracy
by
Ramzi
Yousef
,
who
was
convicted
along
with
him
in
November.

said.

the
240-year-terms
imposed
on

men
convicted

U.S.
attorney
in
Manhattan
,
Mary
Jo
White
,
whose
office
prosecuted
the
case,
said
the
sentence
once
again
sends
a
clear
message
that
this
country
will
respond
to
terrorist
acts
with
the
full
force
of
the
law.
Ismoil
did
not
testify
in
the
trial,
but
his
lawyer,
Louis
R.

,
often
sought
to
distance
his
client
from
Yousef
,
portraying
him
as
a
naive
21-year-old
Jordanian
who
came
to
the
United
States
to
get
an
education
and
a
job,
and
got
swept
into
the
conspiracy.

said
there
was
no
evidence
that
Ismoil
was
a
religious
or
political
fanatic,
like
Yousef
.

said
Ismoil
was
working
in
Texas
when
he
was
called
by
Yousef
and
asked
to
help
in
the
plot.
Ismoil
told
authorities
after
his
arrest
that
he
believed
he
was
transporting
boxes
of
soap
into
the
World
Trade
Center
garage
as
part
of
a
business
deal,
the
jury
was
told.

Friday's
proceeding,
Aidala
again
questioned
whether
there
was
sufficient
evidence
that
Ismoil
knew
he
was
participating
in
a
bombing.

U.S.
Attorney
David
Kelley
argued
that
the
jury
had
made
fair
conclusions
from
the
circumstantial
evidence.

judge
agreed
and
then
echoed
statements
that
he
had
made
in
sentencing
Yousef
in
January,
when
he
said
that
the
convicted
terrorist
had
worshiped
the
god
of
death
and
destruction.

Foner
,

may
not
be
able
to
do
much

these

but
he
does
what
he
can
to
fulfill
the
last
half
of
that
declaration.

decades
he
was
second
in
command
at
1199
,
the
hospital
workers
union,
witnessing
a
tumultuous
era
when
it
went
from
representing
drugstore
clerks
and
pharmacists
to
winning
collective
bargaining
rights
for
thousands
of
low-paid,
behind-the-scenes
workers
at
nonprofit
hospitals.

those
rocky
times,
King
was
a
steadfast
supporter
of
what
he
called
his
favorite
union
and
the
moral
conscience
of
the
labor
movement.

30
years
after
King
was
assassinated
in
Memphis
,
Tenn.
,
people
may
recall
what
the
civil-rights
leader
did
for
the
cause
of
racial
equality.

people
like
Foner
will
never
forget
what
he
did
for
organized
labor,
a
struggle
that
King
cast
in
terms
of
human
rights
and
dignity.

people
know
very
little
about
Dr.
King
,
said
Foner
,
who
directs
the
union's
Bread

project,
which
takes
culture
to
the

King
was
involved

he
was

his
association
with

was
special.

the
two
men

in
1959,
the

was
trying
to
organize

despite
the
obstacles
posed
by
reluctant
managers
and
laws
that
excluded

of

if
you

all
you'll

is

the
hospital

were
receptive
to
the

overtures,
Foner

his
colleagues
decided
they
needed
to
open

King
knew
about
the
union,
and
Foner
was
invited
to
meet
with
him
at
the
home
of
Stanley
Levison
,
a
New
York
businessman
who
was
a
close
adviser
to
King
.

that
meeting,
King
offered
to
write
a
letter
of
support
which
the
union
widely
circulated.

1962,
when
the
union
was
lobbying
to
amend
state
laws
to
allow
collective
bargaining
for
hospital
workers,
King
called
Gov.
Nelson
Rockefeller
three
times
to
urge
his
support.
