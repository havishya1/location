Secretary-General O

report O
last O

in O
which O
he O
outlined O
goals O
for O
the O
United I-LOCATION

in O
assisting O
the O
world's O
most O
under-developed O

that O
report, O
Annan O
, O
the O
first O
sub-Saharan O
African O
to O
head O
the O
United I-LOCATION

, O
said O
African O

must O
demonstrate O
the O
political O
will O
to O
combat O
corruption, O
protect O
human O

and O
pursue O
sound O

the O

time, O
Annan O
said, O
the O
international O

must O
respond O
by O
investing O
in O
Africa I-LOCATION
and O
by O
intervening O
to O
end O
armed O

and O
restore O

Annan O
's O
comments, O
Portugal I-LOCATION
's O
U.N. I-LOCATION
ambassador, O
Antonio O

, O
said O
political O
will O
is O
needed O
from O
the O
international O
community O
to O
help O
Africa I-LOCATION
overcome O
its O
political O
problems. O

will O
and O
courage O
is O
very O
much O
needed O
to O
avoid O
future O
situations O
in O
which O
the O
United I-LOCATION
Nations I-LOCATION
is O
unfortunately O
seen O
to O
have O
turned O
its O
back O
on O
the O
African O
people, O
Monteiro O
said. O

measures O
should O
be O
considered O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
United I-LOCATION
Nations I-LOCATION
and O
the O
Security I-LOCATION
Council I-LOCATION
in O
particular O
provide O
a O
timely O
response O
to O
impending O
crises. O

the O
council's O
willingness O
to O
intervene O
in O
African O
crises O
was O
weakened O
by O
the O
disastrous O
failure O
of O
the O
U.N. I-LOCATION
peacekeeping O
operation O
in O
Somalia I-LOCATION
in O
1993. O

deaths O
of O
18 O
American O
soldiers O
in O
a O
gunbattle O
in O
Mogadishu I-LOCATION
in O
1993 O
led O
the O
United I-LOCATION
States I-LOCATION
to O
withdraw O
from O
the O
operation O
and O
impose O
stringent O
conditions O
on O
future O
U.N. I-LOCATION
peacekeeping O
missions. O
U.N. I-LOCATION
officials O
have O
complained O
those O
conditions O
have O
made O
it O
nearly O
impossible O
for O
the O
United I-LOCATION
Nations I-LOCATION
to O
respond O
quickly O
to O
African O
crises. O

point O
to O
the O
U.S. I-LOCATION
stand O
as O
one O
of O
the O
main O
reasons O
for O
the O
laggard O
U.N. I-LOCATION
response O
to O
the O
1994 O
massacre O
of O
up O
to O
a O
half O
million O
Rwandan O
Tutsis O
and O
moderate O
Hutus O
by O
Hutu O
extremists. O

Security I-LOCATION
Council I-LOCATION
was O
also O
unable O
to O
intervene O
decisively O
in O
last O

rebellion O
in O
the O
Congo I-LOCATION
, O
formerly O
Zaire I-LOCATION
, O
and O
in O
the O
Republic I-LOCATION

, O
where O
a O
former O

overthrew O
an O
elected O
president. O

experience O
of O
intervention O
in O
Somalia I-LOCATION
was O
a O
bitter O
one O
but O
that O
of O
non-intervention O
in O
Rwanda I-LOCATION
was O
perhaps O
worse, O
British O
Ambassador O
John O
Weston O
told O
the O
council. O

cited O
the O
U.N. I-LOCATION
success O
in O
supervising O
the O
transition O
of O
Eastern I-LOCATION
Slavonia I-LOCATION
from O
Serb O
to O
Croat O
control O
as O
an O
example O
of O
how O
the O
United I-LOCATION
Nations I-LOCATION
could O
be O
effective O
given O
the O
right O
mandates O
and O
resources. O
Weston O
said O
proposals O
for O
shifting O
peacekeeping O
to O
regional O
organizations O
_ O
as O
proposed O
by O
the O
Clinton O
Administration O
_ O
cannot O
substitute O
for O
the O
U.N. I-LOCATION
What O
we O
need O
is O
an O
active O
partnership O
with O
Africa I-LOCATION
, O
he O
said. O
France I-LOCATION

U.N. I-LOCATION
ambassador, O
Alain O

prepared O
to O
respond O
and O
work O
with O
its O
U.N. I-LOCATION
partners O
on O
a O
more O
effective O
role O
in O
Africa I-LOCATION
, O
despite O
the O
French O
drawdown O
of O
military O
forces O
on O
the O

Security I-LOCATION
Council I-LOCATION
asked O

to O

on O

in O

for O

forced O

that O

said O
the O

one O

questioning O
the O

on O
its O
move O
to O

now O
in O

his O

that O

were O
actually O
attempts O

Lim O
proposed O
that O
a O

the O

bailing-out O
is O
to O

a O

Opposition I-LOCATION

said O
the O

the O

by O
Nigeria I-LOCATION

five O
political O

of O

Abacha O
seized O

1993 O
