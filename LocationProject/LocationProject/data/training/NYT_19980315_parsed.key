boredom O

Edwards O
, O
boredom O
might O
be O
the O
product. O

is O
not O
remotely O
offensive; O
he O
is O
always O
patient. O

sounds O
as O
if O
he O
has O
all O

like O
a O

Edwards O

that O
nothing O

could O
be O

of O

from O

a O
warm, O
soft O

with O

Ms. O

up, O

all O

the O

impossibly O
vulgar. O

Wertheimer O
and O
the O
afternoon O

Ms. O

share O
the O
remarkable O
ability O
to O
look O
down O
their O
noses O
while O

them. O

from O

so O
ethnic, O

a O
tired O

mildly O
diverting O
play O

for O
their O
laconic O
amusement. O
Siegel O
works O
differently. O

speech O
is O
clipped, O
with O
words O
suddenly O
hurried O
or O
inexplicably O
dragged O
out, O
mumbled O
or O
swallowed: O
aural O
hooks, O
the O
equivalent O
of O
serifs O
on O
a O

except O
that O

don't O
call O

a O

of O
Dick O
Cavett O
in O
Siegel O

interviewing O
style. O

terribly O
earnest, O
while O
at O
the O
same O
time O
suggesting O
he's O
not O
very O
interested. O

like O
a O
well-prepared O
lawyer O
who O
seems O
never O
to O
ask O
a O
question O
to O
which O
he O
doesn't O
already O
know O
the O
answer. O

that O
denial O
of O
the O
chance O
of O
surprise O
that O
is O
so O
deadening. O

is O
nothing O
new O
under O
the O
sun, O
least O
of O
all O
anything O
we O
might O
want O
to O
raise O
our O
voices O
over. O

the O
most O
powerful O
moment O
of O
news O
reporting O
I O
ever O
experienced O
took O
place O
in O
1978, O
on O
the O
night O
the O
news O
of O
the O
mass O
suicides O
and O
murders O
at O
Jonestown I-LOCATION
began O
to O
break. O

television, O
on O
the O
evening O
network O
news O
show, O
the O
anchor O
summed O
up O
the O
facts O
as O
they O
were O
known, O
looked O
at O
the O
papers O
on O
his O
desk O
and, O
lowering O
his O
voice, O
spoke O
of O
this O
awful O
story. O

broke O
the O
code O
of O
news O
broadcasting, O
the O
unspoken O
message O
that O
all O
things O
under O
the O
sun O
take O
place O
within O
the O
limits O
of O
what O
is O
already O
known, O
and O
it O
was O
shocking. O

code O

Gross O
, O
47, O
is O
the O
host O
and O
principal O
interviewer; O
speaking O
on O
the O

last O
week, O
she O
guessed O
that O
since O
the O
program O
began O
more O
than O
20 O
years O
ago, O
she O
has O
done O
9,000 O
or O
10,000 O
interviews. O

each O
one O
seems O
to O
begin O
a O
tale O
from O
the O
beginning. O

the O
show O
is O
conducted O
mostly O
by O
remote O
hookups, O
the O
atmosphere O
is O
invariably O
intimate O
and O
open. O

feeling O
is O
that O
anything O
can O
happen; O
anything O
might O
be O
said. O

Gross O
is O
characteristically O
eager, O
but O
not O
naive. O

hear O
enthusiasm O
in O
her O
voice, O
but O
also O
experience O
and O
skepticism. O

often O
than O
not, O
people O
are O
on O
her O
show O
to O
sell O
their O
books, O
but O
she O
is O
doing O
the O
show O
to O
bring O
them, O
and O
what O
they O
are O
writing O
about, O
to O
life. O

knows O
how O
to O
let O
people O
talk; O
she's O
not O
afraid O
of O
silences, O
or O
above O
a O
noisy O
Blech! O
when O
she's O
repulsed O
by O
a O
creepy O
story. O

dogged; O
she O
can O
give O
the O
impression O
that O
she O
will O
wait O
around O
all O
day O
if O
that's O
what O
it O
takes O
to O
get O
someone O
to O
stop O
faking. O

a O
recent O

Miller O
, O

of O

preening O
true-crime O
novel O
Another O

to O

_ O
Miller O
answered O
every O
other O
question O
with O
some O
variation O
of O
That's O
in O
the O
book. O

spoke O
in O
a O
slow, O
gravelly, O
leering O
voice; O
as O
an O
armed O
robber, O
he O
said, O
he O
had O
lived O
the O
American O
dream O
in O
person. O

met O
Ms. O
Gross O
' O
questions O
with O
heavy O
sighs, O
as O
if O
to O
say: O
Where's O
this O
chick O
been O
all O
her O
life? O
Man, O
do O
I O
have O
to O
explain O
everything? O
It's O
in O
the O
book! O
Asked O
about O
how O
he O
felt O
while O
committing O
robbery, O
Miller O
began O
to O
laugh, O
with O
a O
smug O
insistence O
that O
he O
knew O
things O
Ms. O
Gross O
would O
never O
know. O

so O
funny? O
Ms. O
Gross O
asked O
in O
her O
high, O
pleasant, O
disarming O
voice O
_ O
a O
voice O
that O
in O
an O
instant O
had O
turned O
into O
a O
knife O
_ O
and O
finally O
Miller O
started O
talking. O

Air O
started O
as O
a O
local O

in O

in O
1975, O
Ms. O
Gross O
explained O
when O
we O
talked O
last O
week. O

went O
national O
in O
1985, O
daily O
in O
1987. O

like O

while O

res O

the O

little O

like O
John O

is O
where O
the O

come O
in. O

like O

Mike O

in O

first O
thing O
you O
do O
is O
you O
find O
out O
where O
the O
water O
is. O

next O
thing O
you O
do O
is O
form O
couples, O
start O

notion O
of O
having O
law, O
which O
is O
a O
way O
to O
order O
social O
interactions, O
only O
happens O
after O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
social O
interactions O
such O
that O
they O
become O
problematic. O

in O
a O
legal O
system O
that O
reveres O
precedent O
and O
relies O
on O
analogy, O
even O
defining O
the O
nature O
of O
an O
Internet-related O
dispute O
can O
be O
a O
source O
of O
contention. O

just O
a O
few O
of O
the O
pending O
cases O
and O
the O
questions O
they O
raise O
across O
a O
range O
of O

Cindy O

it O
was O
in O

everyone O

as O
sanguine O
about O
the O

of O

is O
at O

is O
whether O
the O

what O

us O

nobody O

said, O
`Here's O

This O
was O
something O
we O
identified O
as O
a O
priority. O
Yale I-LOCATION

stance O
is O
making O
other O

nervous. O

competition O
has O
definitely O
heated O
up, O
said O
Pam O

, O
who O
helped O

two O
years O

and O
hopes O
that O

Samuelson O
, O
a O
leading O
critic O
of O
the O
Clinton O

proposal O
to O
adapt O
copyright O
law O
to O

said O
Berkeley I-LOCATION
's O
advantage O
was O
being O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
industry O
that O
is O
creating O
so O
many O
of O
today's O
legal O
challenges. O

Samuelson O
said O
that O
centers O
like O
Berkeley I-LOCATION
's O
would O
teach O
different O
skills O
and O
values O
than O
the O
traditional O
law O

has O
taught. O

than O
trying O
to O
develop O
fixed O
sets O
of O
black-letter O
law O
rules O
that O
you O
can O
memorize O
and O
then O
apply, O
this O
requires O
that O
students O
learn O
to O
be O
supple O
and O
adaptable, O
Ms. O
Samuelson O
said. O

by O
most O
accounts O
Harvard I-LOCATION

is O
at O
the O
center O
of O
an O
active O
debate O
among O
lawyers O
about O
whether O
the O
emergence O
of O

requires O
a O
whole O
new O
legal O
model. O

is O
a O
division O
between O
the O
incrementalists O
and O
the O
radicals, O
Post O
said. O

me O
it O
makes O
more O
sense O
to O
think O
of O
this O
as O
a O
separate O
domain O
of O
interaction O
that's O
going O
to O
have O
its O
own O
rules. O

stress O
that O
the O
new O
technology O
places O
on O
existing O
law O
has O
provoked O
some O
scholars O
to O
argue O
that O
cyberspace O
needs O
laws O
of O
its O
own O
in O
areas O
like O
copyright O
and O
privacy. O

wonder O
whether O
at O
a O
time O
when O
private O
companies O
wield O
power O
over O
online O
behavior O
by O
computer O
code, O
constitutional O
principles O
should O
regulate O
private O
as O
well O
as O
state O
action. O

many O
legal O
scholars O
scoff O
at O
the O
notion O
that O
cyberspace O
presents O
the O
need O
for O
a O
new O
discipline. O

Law O

Easterbrook O

law O
of O

makes O
about O
as O
much O
sense O
as O
a O
law O
of O
horses, O
he O
said. O

even O
critics O
agree O
that O
the O
emergence O
of O
cyberspace O
is O
forcing O
the O
deepest O
and O
most O
critical O
consideration O
in O
years O
of O
law O
in O
general. O

dividing O
the O
world O
up O
into O

artificial, O
said O
Brian O
Dally O
, O

a O
student O
in O
Lessig O
's O
cyberspace O
law O
class. O

really O
came O
rushing O
to O
the O
fore O
for O
me O
in O
this O
class O
is O
that O
this O
should O
give O
us O
pause O
to O
examine O
some O
of O
our O
basic O
understandings O
about O
the O

SITES: O
TUNING O

ON O
THE O

Once O
upon O
a O
time, O
before O
the O
Internet O
had O
pictures O
and O
was O
all O
the O
rage, O
Quincy O
Jones O
, O
the O
music O
impresario, O
sat O
with O
Bill O
Gates O
, O
the O
computer O
magnate, O
at O
a O
technology O
conference, O
talking O
about O
the O
future. O

year O
was O
1992, O
and O
the O
conversation O
was O
a O
melding O
of O
the O
two O
titans' O
respective O
passions: O
the O
preservation O
of O
musical O
cultures O
and O
the O
nascent O
online O
universe O
that O
would O
become O
cyberspace. O

took O
six O
years O
to O
realize O
a O
complete O
fusion O
of O
the O
vision O
that O
emerged O
that O
night. O

Wednesday, O
Jones O
will O
introduce O
Qradio I-LOCATION
, O
a O
venture O
that O
marries O
the O
Internet O
to O
his O
advocacy O
of O
the O
rich, O
varied O
and O
largely O
unknown O
music O
of O
developing O
nations. O

radio, O
a O
technology O
that O
transmits O
audio O
programming O
to O
Internet-connected O
personal O
computers, O
offers O
the O
potential O
to O
reach O
a O
wide O
audience O
at O
a O
fraction O
of O
the O
cost O
of O
traditional O
broadcasting. O

a O
different O
sort O
of O
landscape, O
a O
21st-century O
language, O
Jones O
said O
of O
the O
Internet. O

while O
his O
site O
is O
devoted O
to O
music, O
unlike O
broadcast O
radio, O
it O
is O
not O
limited O
to O
sound. O

it O
is O
a O
multimedia O
product O
of O
which O
actual O
radio O
is O
only O
a O
part. O

it O
is O
being O
formally O
introduced O
this O
week, O
Qradio I-LOCATION
began O
in O
February O
with O
an O
initial O
focus O
on O
South I-LOCATION
Africa I-LOCATION
. O

offers O
a O
data O
base O
of O
South O
African O
musicians, O
including O
biographies, O
discographies O
and O
sample O
clips, O
a O
multimedia O
history O
of O
musical O
evolution O
in O
the O
region O
and O
continuous O
feeds O
of O
three O
of O
South I-LOCATION
African I-LOCATION
Broadcasting I-LOCATION
Corp. I-LOCATION
's O
16 O
radio O
stations. O
Qradio I-LOCATION
, O
which O
was O
started O
with O
$5 O
million O
in O
private O
investments, O
plans O
to O
sell O
advertising, O
but O
it O
hopes O
to O
derive O
revenue O
from O
the O
sale O
of O
CDs O
and O
audio O
tapes O
marketed O
by O
means O
of O
online O
music O
samples. O
Jones O
and O
his O
partners O
in O
the O
venture O
say O
they O
hope O
eventually O
to O
broaden O
the O
site O
to O
embrace O
music O
from O
other O
parts O
of O
Africa I-LOCATION
, O
as O
well O
as O
from O
the O
Americas I-LOCATION
. O

it O
could O
serve O
as O
a O
medium O
for O
breeding O
new O
species O
of O
music, O
but O
for O
now, O
Jones O
suggests O
that O
the O
goal O
is O
to O
build O
bridges O
between O
cultures O
and O
technological O
classes. O

we O
are, O
entering O
the O
next O
century, O
he O
said. O

number O
with O
three O
zeroes O
behind O
it O
is O
very O
heavy. O

ironic O
_ O
here O
we O
are O
dealing O
with O
the O
Internet O
and O
some O
of O
these O
people O
in O
South I-LOCATION
Africa I-LOCATION
don't O
have O
electricity. O
Adam O
Clayton O
Powell O
III O
, O
a O
lifelong O
friend O
and O
former O
employee O
of O
Jones O
, O
said O
the O
seed O
that O
germinated O
into O
Qradio I-LOCATION
was O
a O
1991 O
trip O
that O
the O
two O
of O
them O
took O
to O
South I-LOCATION
Africa I-LOCATION
just O
as O
that O
nation's O
legacy O
of O
apartheid O
was O
collapsing. O

the O
time, O
Powell O
said, O
the O
two O
men O
discussed O
the O
feasibility O
of O
a O
cable O
channel O
to O
promote O
the O
various O
indigenous O
musical O
cultures O
of O
the O
region, O
but O
the O
costs O
for O
such O
a O
venture O
were O
prohibitive. O

then, O
Powell O
said, O
the O
notion O
of O
using O
online O
technologies O
as O
a O
delivery O
mechanism O
piqued O
Jones O
' O
interest. O

have O
got O
to O
come O
back, O
to O
South I-LOCATION
Africa I-LOCATION
, O
Powell O
, O
now O
the O
vice O
president O
for O

of O
the O
Freedom I-LOCATION
Forum I-LOCATION
in O
Arlington I-LOCATION
, O
Va. I-LOCATION
, O
recalls O
his O
friend O
saying. O

would O
take O
the O
development O
of O
the O
World O
Wide O
Web O
and O
the O
technology O
known O
as O
streaming O
audio O
before O
the O
possibility O
of O
online O
radio O
transmission O
would O
be O
realized. O

the O
technology O
alone O
cannot O
ensure O
that O
anyone O
will O
be O
listening, O
and O
industry O
analysts O
question O
whether O
a O
medium O
born O
in O
the O
1920s O
will O
ever O
find O
an O
acceptable O
fit O
in O
the O
medium O
of O
the O
millennium. O

put O
radio O
on O
the O
Internet O
is O
not O
what O
it's O
all O
about, O
said O
Alan O
Brody O
, O
an O
independent O
media O
analyst O
in O
Scarsdale I-LOCATION
, O
N.Y. I-LOCATION
It's O
like O
using O
TV O
to O
broadcast O
shipbuilding O
information. O

a O
cute O
idea, O
but O
that's O
not O
where O
the O
future O
is. O

future O
is O
in O
personalizing O
what O
we O
hear O
on O
the O
radio. O
Powell O
disagreed. O

that O
virtually O
all O
new O
personal O
computers O
are O
equipped O
with O
audio O
capability, O
more O
people O
than O
ever O
will O
use O
the O
Web O
as O
a O
platform O
for O
radio-like O
programming. O

is O
the O
most O
ubiquitous O
medium O
we O
have, O
Powell O
said. O

a O
form O
familiar O
to O
us O
as O
a O
species. O

have O
a O
long O
tradition O
of O
oral O
history, O
and O
this O
fits O
that O
tradition. O

the O

that O

they O
are O
wary O
of O

that O

put O

out O
of O

to O

what O

With O

no O

a O

now O
that O
the O

have O
taken O

by O
Gov. O
Michael O
Leavitt O
of O
Utah I-LOCATION

Gov. O
Roy O

, O
the O

is O
willing O
to O
accept O
a O
permanent O
prohibition O
on O

in O
return, O
it O
wants O
Washington I-LOCATION

give O

powerful O
incentive O
to O
create O

both O

association's O
proposal O
would O
override O
the O
Supreme I-LOCATION
Court I-LOCATION
ruling O
by O
requiring O
large O
vendors O
to O
collect O
use O
taxes O
on O
behalf O
of O
states O
as O
long O
as O
the O
states O
conformed O
to O

is O
the O
time O
for O
a O

filed O
for O
all O

Leavitt O
said. O

the O
governors' O
approach O
faces O
strong O
opposition. O

their O
bill O
would O
meet O
the O
primary O
objective O
of O
Internet O
service O
providers, O
it O
would O
also O
open O
Internet O
commerce O
to O
taxation. O

see O
this O
as O
a O
new O

that O
would O
generate O
$16 O
billion O
in O
revenue O
by O
the O
year O
2000, O
Wyden O
said. O

more O
important, O
it O
would O
tie O
Internet O
tax O
legislation O
to O
the O
fate O
of O
the O
states' O
attempts O
to O
force O
mail-order O
vendors O
to O
collect O
taxes O
from O
out-of-state O
customers. O

because O
there O
is O
hardly O
a O
ground O
swell O
for O
such O
a O
move O
in O
Congress I-LOCATION
, O
there O
might O
be O
no O
legislation O
at O
all O
_ O
a O
result O
that O
would O
not O
unduly O
disturb O
most O
opponents O
of O
the O
Internet O
Tax O
Freedom O
Act. O
The O
governors, O
it O
is O
generally O
conceded, O
are O
playing O
a O
weak O
political O
hand. O

House O
leaders O
are O
promising O
a O
floor O
vote O
on O
the O
Cox-Wyden O
bill O
this O
month. O

last O
week, O
Senate I-LOCATION
Majority O
Leaser O
Trent O

predicted O
that O
the O
bill O
would O
come O
to O
a O
vote O
in O
the O
Senate I-LOCATION
by O
May. O
The O
real O
question, O
then, O
is O
whether O
the O
governors O
can O
salvage O
a O
compromise O
with O
the O
bill's O
congressional O
sponsors. O

persuaded O
there O
is O
still O
a O

however, O

that O

however, O
mean O

to O
stay O
longer O
_ O

do O

an O

Yet O

will O
find O
it O
in O
their O

almost O
always O
a O
way O
that O
someone O
will O
make O

if O

way, O

rather O
than O
having O

one O
reason O
for O

the O
difference O

important: O
Open I-LOCATION

did O

regardless O

The O

the O

a O
result O

only O
a O
small O

seemed O
a O

that O

Kaufman O

decision O
made O
sense O
on O
a O
lot O

Ms. O

mainly O
because O
it O

because O
they O
draw O

these O

not O
all O

it O

danger O
remains O
that O
if O
a O

is O
not O
successful, O
then O
the O

him O

the O

by O
all O
accounts, O
the O
biggest O

to O
have O
emerged O
in O

never O
seen O
a O

like O
this, O
said O
Sherry O

what O
to O
relate O
it O
to O
_ O
the O
Beatles I-LOCATION
, O
Elvis O
, O
Frank O
Sinatra O
in O
his O
heyday. O

frenzy O
is O
not O
just O
about O
his O
looks O
but O
his O
talent. O

blond O
23-year-old O
actor, O
whose O
androgynous O
good O
looks O
make O
him O
seem O
almost O
like O
a O
teen-ager O
(which O
is O
part O
of O
his O
appeal O
to O
young O
girls), O
is, O
of O
course, O
the O
co-star O
with O
Kate O
Winslet O
of O

in O
which O
he O
plays O
the O
artist-lover O
of O
an O

his O

Philippe O
. O

films O
grossed O
an O
estimated O
$17.5 O

DiCaprio O
's O
rapid O
rise O
to O

is O
underscored O
by O
his O
financial O
demands. O

signed O

earned O
about O

demands O
for O
a O
studio O
film O
are O
now O
in O
the O
$20 O
million O
range, O
placing O
him O
on O
par O
with O
Cruise O
, O
Ford O
and O
a O
handful O
of O

what O
seems O
highly O
unusual O
about O
DiCaprio O
, O
in O
contrast O
with O
stars O
like O
Cruise O
or O
Gibson O
, O
is O
that, O
by O
all O
accounts, O
he O
is O
not O
especially O
comfortable O
with, O
and O
actually O
dislikes, O
his O
image O
as O
a O
movie O
idol, O
not O
only O
in O
the O
United I-LOCATION
States I-LOCATION
but O
abroad. O

filmmakers O
who O
know O
him O
said O
that O
the O
star O
already O
felt O
trapped O
by O
his O
romantic O
image O
among O
teen-agers O
and O
viewed O
himself O
as O
a O
serious O
actor O
who O
sought O
roles O
with O
other O
talented O
actors O
and O
A-list O
directors. O

only O
other O
forthcoming O
role O
is O
in O
a O
new O
Woody O
Allen O
project, O
called O
Celebrity, O
to O
be O
released O
later O
this O
year.) O
What's O
also O
unusual O
about O
DiCaprio O
is O
that O
he O
does O
not O
fall O
within O
the O
tradition O
of O
rugged O
classic O
stars O
like O
Clark O
Gable O
, O
or O
romantic O
heroes O
like O
Cary O
Grant O
, O
or O
archetypal O
American O
figures O
like O
James O
Stewart O
, O
or O
even O
character O
stars O
like O
Spencer O
Tracy O
, O
James O
Cagney O
or O
Humphrey O
Bogart O
. O

DiCaprio O
seems O
to O
most O
resemble O
Montgomery O
Clift O
and O
James O
Dean O
, O
whose O
performances O
were O
marked O
by O
brooding O
and O
sensitive O
roles O
that O
especially O
appealed O
to O
teen-agers. O
DiCaprio O
's O
longevity O
as O
a O
star O
remains, O
of O
course, O
unknown. O

present-day O
Hollywood I-LOCATION
, O
actors O
are O
heralded O
as O
stars, O
mostly O
by O
the O
publicity O
machine, O
but O
then O
fade. O

year O
Vanity I-LOCATION
Fair I-LOCATION
hailed O
Matthew O
McConaughey O
as O
the O
next O
Paul O
Newman O
. O

a O
series O
of O
disappointing O
films O
have O
dimmed O
McConaughey O
's O
stardom. O

Damon O
of O
Good O
Will O
Hunting O
is O
getting O
a O
similar O
star O
treatment O
now. O

DiCaprio O
is O
seen, O
somehow, O
differently. O

his O
teen-age O
years, O
he O
has O
been O
a O
sought-after O
actor O
in O
Hollywood I-LOCATION
and O
viewed O
as O
a O
performer O
with O
an O
unusually O
broad O
acting O
range. O

are O
confusing O
his O
looks O
with O
his O
talent, O
remarked O
Lindsay O

it O
was O
the O

that O
created O
the O
emotion O
that O
got O
all O
mixed O
up O
with O
how O
adorable O
those O

were. O
DiCaprio O
earned O
an O
Academy O
Award O
nomination O
for O
best O
supporting O
actor O
at O
19 O
for O
his O
portrayal O
of O
a O
mentally O
impaired O
youngster O
in O
What's O
Eating O
Gilbert O

gained O
further O
attention O
in O
This O
Boy's O
Life O
(1993), O
a O
harrowing O
drama O
in O
which O
he O
played O

that O

Wallace O

said: O
Most O
actors O
are O
like O
most O
people O
_ O
they're O
actually O
scared O
to O
play O
roles O
in O
which O
they O
portray O
openness O
and O
heroism O
because O
they O
have O
an O
inherent O
and O
usually O
unspoken O
fear O
that O
to O
attempt O
such O
a O
role O
would O
be O
to O
reveal O
their O
own O
inherent O
shallowness O
and O
cowardice. O

actors O
hide O
behind O
quirkiness O
and O
cynicism. O

one O
would O
accuse O
Leo O
of O
that. O

is O
the O
last O
thing O
that O
he's O
about. O
Tom O
Rothman O
, O
president O
of O

Fox I-LOCATION
, O
put O
in O
another O
way: O
What O
you O
have O
in O
Leo O
is O
a O
gigantic O
star O
_ O
and O
remember, O
he's O
a O
star O
worldwide O
_ O
who's O
somehow O
able O
to O
open O
himself O
up O
on O
screen O
and O
let O
you O
in O
emotionally... O

feel O
what O
his O
character O
in O

feels. O

same O

not O

there O

plenty O

_ O
The O
day O
after O
his O
production O
of O
Lohengrin O
received O
a O
hostile O
reception O
at O
the O
Metropolitan I-LOCATION
Opera I-LOCATION
, O
Robert O
Wilson O
, O
with O
commitments O
to O
keep, O
flew O
to O
Europe I-LOCATION
. O

the O
telephone O
from O
Geneva I-LOCATION
, O
the O
director O
expressed O
his O
surprise O
at O
the O
reaction, O
and O
tried O
to O
explain O
the O
reason O
behind O
it. O

Wagner O
, O
there O
is O
a O
society O
that's O
very O
closed, O
he O
said. O

regard O
`Lohengrin' O
as O
19th-century O
romanticism O
and O
want O
to O
guard O
it. O

made O
it O
clear O
that O
he O
considered O
Wagnerians O
a O
distinct O
breed O
of O
classicists, O
rigid O
in O
their O
overprotectiveness. O

that O
opening-night O
performance O
last O
week, O
the O
audience O
enthusiastically O
applauded O
each O
of O
the O
leading O
singers O
and O
James O
Levine O
, O
who O
had O
conducted O
the O
orchestra. O

Levine O
brought O
Wilson O
onstage, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
sudden, O
loud O
chorus O
of O
boos, O
echoing O
through O
the O
opera O
house. O

who O
were O
applauding O
clapped O
harder, O
and O
there O
were O
a O
few O
lonely O
bravos. O

the O
jeers O
resoundingly O
outnumbered O
the O
cheers. O

a O
second O
round O
of O
bows, O
the O
response O
was O
the O
same. O

the O
third O
round, O
Wilson O
brought O
his O
costume O
designer, O
Frida O
Parmeggiani O
, O
forward O
with O
him O
(possibly O
to O
shield O
himself O
from O
the O
naysayers). O

his O
long O
international O
career O
as O
an O
innovative O
director O
of O
theater O
and O
opera, O
Wilson O
has O
always O
stirred O
the O
strongest O
reactions. O

in O
Europe I-LOCATION
, O
he O
is O
regarded O
as O
an O
icon O
of O
experimental O
theater, O
greeted O
with O
appreciative O
cries O
of O
Bobwilson. O

is O
certainly O
accustomed O
to O
criticism, O
in O
public O
and O
in O
print, O
but O
the O
Met I-LOCATION
reception O
was O
excessive O
and O
extraordinarily O
rude. O

was O
as O
if O
he O
had O
committed O
a O
crime O
against O
the O
audience. O
Wilson O
said O
that O
standing O
on O
the O
stage, O
struck O
by O
a O
wave O
of O
derision, O
he O
thought, O
Wow! O
wondering O
what O
had O
provoked O
such O
a O
visceral O
response. O

he O
said: O
I O
didn't O
do O
anything O
so O
radical. O

didn't O
ask O
the O
singers O
to O
sing O
upside O
down. O

he O
did O
was O
to O
strip O
the O
opera O
of O
its O
romantic O
trappings O
and O
present O
it O
in O
an O
abstract O
modern O
manner, O
with O
a O
minimum O
of O
scenery O
and O
with O
lighting O
used O
to O
denote O
both O
environment O
and O
atmosphere. O

the O
singers, O
a O
shimmering O
Rothko O
-like O
rectangle O
changed O
color O
according O
to O
mood O
and, O
in O
Wilson O
's O
signature O
style, O
bars O
of O
light, O
both O
horizontal O
and O
vertical, O
were O
substituted O
for O
traditional O
woods O
and O
palaces. O

back O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
project, O
he O
said O
that O
he O
had O
seen O
a O
photograph O
of O
a O
production O
of O
Hamlet O
in O
which O
the O
ghost O
was O
an O
ordinary O
man O
sitting O
at O
a O
desk. O

considered O
the O
possibility O
of O
staging O
Lohengrin O
in O
a O
similar O
realistic O
fashion. O

inspired O
by O
Wagner O
's O
own O
drawings, O
he O
began O
to O
see O
the O
stage O
space O
in O
abstract O
terms. O

for O
the O
architecture O
of O
that O
space, O
he O
decided O
to O
frame O
the O
opera O
with O
lighting O
and O
to O
present O
it O
in O
a O
simple O
way, O
so O
you O
could O
concentrate O
on O
the O
music, O
while O
knowing O
that O
the O
simplest O
line O
is O
the O
most O
difficult. O

the O
same O
time, O
he O
retained O
Wagner O
's O
wing O
of O
a O
swan O
as O
a O
central O
motif. O

of O
the O
work's O
mythic O
elements O
and O
outsize O
emotions, O
he O
said, O
it O
could O
easily O
be O
made O
to O
seem O
ridiculous: O
If O
I O
did O
the O
opera O
in O
an O
overly O
theatrical O
way, O
that O
would O
diminish O
the O
music. O

other O
productions, O
he O
added, O
Often O
the O
music O
is O
diminished. O

all O
costs, O
he O
wanted O
to O
help O
the O
Met I-LOCATION
singers O
feel O
more O
comfortable O
on O
stage O
and O
to O
give O
their O
best O
performances. O

was O
trying O
to O
be O
respectful O
to O
the O
text, O
the O
story O
and O
Wagner O
, O
he O
said. O

has O
to O
pay O
respect O
to O
the O
master, O
but O
one O
has O
to O
be O
careful O
not O
to O
become O
a O
slave. O

said O
that O
a O
classic O
should O
not O
be O
rooted O
in O
a O
single O
time O
or O
place: O
This O
ancient O
story O
must O
be O
timeless. O

must O
be O
present, O
too. O

CAN O
END O
HERE. O

MATERIAL O
FOLLOWS) O
Whether O
he O
is O
doing O
Wagner O
or O
Virgil O
Thomson O
, O
he O
often O
encounters O
resistance. O

remembered O
that O
when O
he O
did O
Richard O
Strauss O
' O
Salome O
at O
La I-LOCATION
Scala I-LOCATION
in O
1987, O
his O
diva O
Montserrat O
Caballe O
persuaded O
him O
to O
take O
a O
bow O
with O
her: O
They O
booed; O
they O
bravoed. O

booing O
was O
less. O
Wilson O
's O
only O
previous O
encounter O
with O
the O
Met I-LOCATION
was O
in O
1986 O
with O
Einstein O
on O
the O
Beach, O
an O
opera O
he O
created O
with O
Philip O
Glass O
. O

was O
not O
part O
of O
the O
Met I-LOCATION
repertory O
but O
was O
an O
independent O
production O
paid O
for O
by O
Wilson O
. O

he O
lost O
money O
on O
the O
venture.) O
On O
opening O
night O
there O
were O
a O
few O
walkouts, O
but O
those O
who O
stayed O
for O
the O
nearly O
five-hour O
epic O
greeted O
it O
with O
a O
thunderous O
ovation. O

recent O
shows O
like O
The O
Black O
Rider O
and O
Time O
Rocker O
at O
the O
Brooklyn I-LOCATION
Academy I-LOCATION
of I-LOCATION
Music I-LOCATION
, O
theatergoers O
attuned O
to O
his O
work O
arrive O
with O
Wilsonian O
expectations. O

said O
that O
in O
contrast O
to O
the O
opera O
public, O
theater O
and O
particularly O
dance O
audiences O
are O
able O
to O
approach O
a O
production O
as O
a O
visual O
art, O
to O
look O
at O
it O
as O
they O
might O
look O
at O
a O
painting. O

said O
that O
people O
are O
accustomed O
to O
seeing O
Shakespeare O
in O
all O
possible O
situations: O
updated, O
undated, O
deconstructed O
or O
even O
as O
a O
monologue, O
as O
in O
Wilson O
's O
own O
one-man O
performance O
of O
Hamlet. O

equanimity, O
he O
has O
also O
directed O
imaginative O
interpretations O
of O
plays O
by O
Ibsen O
, O
Buechner O
, O
Brecht O
and O
others. O

he O
is O
doing O
a O
new O
work O
or O
a O
classic, O
he O
makes O
bold O
artistic O
choices. O

he O
indulges O
in O
a O
kind O
of O
brinksmanship. O

one O
point O
in O
his O
version O
of O
The O
Magic O
Flute O
several O
years O
ago O
at O
the O
Bastille I-LOCATION
Opera I-LOCATION
in O
Paris I-LOCATION
, O
he O
had O
a O
toy O
ambulance O
zip O
across O
the O
stage, O
an O
antic O
Wilson O
touch. O

leading O
singer O
objected, O
giving O
him O
the O
choice O
of O
either O
her O
or O
the O
toy O
car. O

a O
directorial O
compromise, O
the O
car O
was O
eliminated. O

were O
no O
such O
anachronisms O
in O
his O
Lohengrin. O

Lohengrin, O
the O
difficulty O
was O
in O
daring O
to O
direct O
a O
Wagnerian O
classic O
at O
the O
Met I-LOCATION
. O

seemed O
apparent O
that O
no O
matter O
what O
Wilson O
did O
to O
Wagner O
would O
have O
been O
abhorrent O
to O
a O
large O
segment O
of O
the O
audience. O

the O
premiere, O
the O
controversy O
continued O
over O
the O
Internet. O

his O
brief O
trip O
to O
Europe I-LOCATION
, O
the O
director O
busily O
immersed O
himself O
in O
two O
forthcoming O
projects: O
a O
production O
of O
Ibsen O
's O
Lady O
From O
the O
Sea O
(starring O
Dominique O
Sanda O
) O
in O
Milan I-LOCATION
, O
Italy I-LOCATION
, O
and O
a O
workshop O
of O
a O
contemporary O
opera O
by O
Tania O
Leon O
in O
Geneva I-LOCATION
. O

indicated O
that O
he O
was O
undiscouraged O
by O
the O
Met I-LOCATION
experience. O

go O
from O
one O
thing O
to O
the O
next, O
and O
I O
don't O
think O
about O
it, O
he O
said. O

rather, O
he O
was O
trying O
not O
to O
think O
about O
it. O

to O
such O
an O
internationally O
acclaimed O
artist O
like O
Wilson O
, O
such O
treatment O
must O
be O
hurtful. O

remembered O
once O
receiving O
advice O
from O
Diana O
Vreeland O
: O
Don't O
worry, O
Bob O
. O

years O
they O
love O
you; O
some O
years O
they O
hate O
you. O

do O
the O
work. O

would O
he O
do O
more O
Wagner O
? O
Maybe O
I'll O
do O
`The O
Ring' O
now, O
he O
said, O
in O
full O
awareness O
that O
such O
an O
announcement O
could O
cause O
a O
seismic O
shudder O
at O
the O
Met I-LOCATION
. O

returning O
to O
New I-LOCATION

, O
he O
plans O
to O
attend O
the O
performances O
of O

Tuesday O
and O

if O
he O
would O
appear O
onstage O
with O
the O

No! O

simplifies O

laughs O
at O
the O

he O
sets O
out O
to O

that O
when O

Go-you-forth/from O
your O

your O

the O

that O

let O
you O
see, O
something O
new O
in O

a O
migration O
in O
the O
wrong O
direction O
that O
would O
change O
the O
face O
of O
the O
earth I-LOCATION
. O

in O
his O
reading O
of O
the O
Hebrew O
Bible O
he O
not O
only O
traces O
the O
development O
of O
the O
Hebrew O
God O
from O
the O
figure O
who O
heavy-handedly O
called O
for O
the O
near-sacrifice O
of O
Isaac O
because O
He O
had O
to O
jump-start O
this O
new O
religion, O
and O
He O
didn't O
always O
have O
the O
best O
material O
to O
work O
with, O
to O
what O
the O
King O
James O
calls O
the O
still, O
small O
voice O
that O
the O

also O
contrasts O
this O

with O
what O

namely O
what O
the O

offering O
up O

an O

without O

that O
the O

the O
