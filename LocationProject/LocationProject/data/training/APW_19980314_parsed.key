John O

the O

of O
the O

came O

was O
hurriedly O
called O
as O
anxiety O

in O
the O
Vatican I-LOCATION

who O

at O
the O
1987 O
meeting O
said O
the O
Vatican I-LOCATION

ground-breaking O

was O
the O

to O
Rome I-LOCATION

main O
synagogue O
in O
1986. O

fall, O
the O
pope O
told O
a O
Vatican I-LOCATION
seminar O
on O
anti-Jewish O
currents O
in O
Christian O
theology O
that O
centuries O
of O
anti-Jewish O
prejudice O
had O
figured O

deadening O

toe O
the O
Nazi I-LOCATION
persecution O
of O

to O
the O
disappointment O
of O
some O

the O

steered O
