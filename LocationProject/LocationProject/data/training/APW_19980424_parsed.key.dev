_
Recalling
U.N.
failures
in

,
Security
Council
members
said
Friday
the
international
community
must
demonstrate
the
political
will
to
help
Africa
overcome
its
economic
and
social
problems.

calls
came
during
an
all-day
debate
on
Africa
to
review
Secretary-General
Kofi
Annan
's
report
last
week,
in
which
he
outlined
goals
for
the
United
Nations
in
assisting
the
world's
most
under-developed
continent.

that
report,
Annan
,
the
first
sub-Saharan
African
to
head
the
United

,
said
African
leaders
must
demonstrate
the
political
will
to
combat
corruption,
protect
human
rights
and
pursue
sound
economic
policies.

the
same
time,
Annan
said,
the
international
community
must
respond
by
investing
in
Africa
and
by
intervening
to
end
armed
conflicts
and
restore
stability.

to
help

political
problems.

will
and
courage
is
very
much
needed
to
avoid
future
situations
in
which
the
United

is
unfortunately
seen
to
have
turned
its
back
on
the
African
people,
Monteiro
said.

measures
should
be
considered
to
ensure
that
the
United
Nations
and
the
Security
Council
in
particular
provide
a
timely
response
to
impending
crises.

the
council's
willingness
to
intervene
in
African
crises
was
weakened
by
the
disastrous
failure
of
the
U.N.
peacekeeping
operation
in
Somalia
in
1993.

deaths
of
18
American
soldiers
in
a
gunbattle
in
Mogadishu
in
1993
led
the
United
States
to
withdraw
from
the
operation
and
impose
stringent
conditions
on
future
U.N.
peacekeeping
missions.
U.N.
officials
have
complained
those
conditions
have
made
it
nearly
impossible
for
the
United
Nations
to
respond
quickly
to
African
crises.

the
U.S.

as
one
of
the
main
reasons
for
the
laggard
U.N.
response
to
the
1994
massacre
of
up
to
a
half
million
Rwandan
Tutsis
and
moderate
Hutus
by
Hutu
extremists.

Security
Council
was
also
unable
to
intervene
decisively
in
last
year's
rebellion
in
the
Congo
,
formerly
Zaire
,
and
in
the
Republic
of
Congo
,
where
a
former
dictator
overthrew
an
elected
president.

experience
of
intervention
in
Somalia
was
a
bitter
one
but
that
of
non-intervention
in
Rwanda
was
perhaps
worse,
British
Ambassador
John
Weston
told
the
council.

cited
the
U.N.
success
in
supervising
the
transition
of
Eastern
Slavonia
from
Serb
to
Croat
control
as
an
example
of
how
the
United
Nations
could
be
effective
given
the
right
mandates
and
resources.
Weston
said
proposals
for
shifting
peacekeeping
to
regional
organizations
_
as
proposed
by
the
Clinton
Administration
_
cannot
substitute
for
the
U.N.
What
we
need
is
an
active
partnership
with
Africa
,
he
said.
France
's
U.N.
ambassador,
Alain
Dejammet
,
said
France
was
prepared
to
respond
and
work
with
its
U.N.
partners
on
a
more
effective
role
in
Africa
,
despite
the
French
drawdown
of
military
forces
on
the
continent.

Security
Council
asked
Annan
to
prepare
the
report
following
a
meeting
on
Africa
held
in
September
during
the
annual
General
Assembly
debate.

United
States
sought
the
meeting
to
draw
international
attention
to
the
problems
facing
Africa
.
Annan
said
he
would
deliver
that
message
during
a

the
Dewan

that
some
of

for
a
second
reading,
he
said
a
new
section
had
been
proposed
to
empower
the
Registrar
of
Companies
to
refuse
registration
of
the

of
a

amendments
also
seek
to
provide
additional
grounds
for
the
courts
to
compulsorily
wind
up
a
company
if
it
is
being
used
as
specified
above.
Subramaniam
said
the
amendments
were
also
aimed
at
ensuring
companies
would
be
more
responsible
in
matters
pertaining
to
their
accounts.

the

Datuk
Abu

felt
suitable
measures
must
be
introduced
to
help
companies
facing
problems
due
to
economic
uncertainties.

proposed
that
creditors
and
management
of
companies
find
an
amicable
solution
to
overcome
their
financial
difficulties.

said
the
ROC
needed
to
improve
its
services
and
administration,
and
one
way
this
could
be
achieved
was
through
its
corporatisation.
Lim
Kit
Siang
(
DAP
-
Tanjung
)
focused
his
debate
on
one
of
his
favourite
topics
-
questioning
the
Government
on
its
move
to
bail
out
companies
now
in
difficulties
due
to
economic
problems.

his
stand
that
the
various
corporate
exercises
involving
companies
like
Malaysia
Airlines
,
Renong
,
Konsortium
Perkapalan
,
United
Engineers
Malaysia
and
others
were
actually
attempts
to
rescue
companies
which
had
connections
with
the
Government,
Lim
proposed
that
a
commission
be
established
to
handle
the
task.

bailing-out
is
to
become
a
government
policy,
set
up
this
commission
where
everyone
can
submit
their
applications
for
them
to
be
vetted
fairly,
regardless
of
whether
they
are
big
or
small
companies,
with
or
without
connections.
Lim
also
questioned
Ekran
Bhd
's
move
in
using
proceeds
from
a
rights
issue
although
it
differed
from
the
original
intended
purpose,
saying
the
case
would
be
a
test
to
the
performance
of
the
regulatory
authorities.

Opposition
leader
said
he
did
not
object
to
the
amendments
but
hoped
the
additional
powers
would
not
be
used
to
silence
NGOs
from
criticising
government
policies
or
actions.
Husni
Hanadzlah
(
BN

)
hoped
the
proposed
amendments
would
enhance
the

the

and
ensure
non-abuse
of

the
MP
said
a

be
conducted
to
ensure
all
public
companies
adhered
to
the
regulation
to
hold
audit
committee
meetings
four
times
a

said
the
amendment

the
information

must
not
be

lauding
the
proposed
amendments,
Michael
Lisa
Kaya
(

)
said
the
proposed
inclusion
of
Section

a
good
move
in
keeping
abreast
of
national
development
and
the
Government's
aspirations
in

proposed
amendment
would
see
the
insertion
of
this
section
for

of

Registrar
may
provide
a
service
for
the

MP
said
NGOs
would
be
prevented
from
misleading
the
public
and
causing
disharmony
with
the
introduction
of
the
amendment.

Sahabat
Alam
Malaysia
as
an
example,
the
MP
questioned
its
motives
in
playing
a
role
in
the
setting
up
of
human
blockades
in
Sarawak
in
1991.

of
inciting
the
natives,
why
don't
they
just
educate
them
by
holding
seminars,
he
asked.

more
than
two
weeks,
he
added,
the
people
suffered
by
participating
in
the
blockades
instead
of
cultivating
their
land.
Mentakab
MP
Fu
Ah
Kiow
also
supported
the
proposed
amendment
to
introduce
electronic
filing
and
said
this
would
help
in
streamlining
the
efficiency
of
the
ROC
's

process.

_
U.N.
Security
Council
members
said
Friday
the
international
community
must
demonstrate
the
political
will
to
help
Africa
overcome
its
economic
and
social
problems.

calls
came
during
an
all-day
debate
on
Africa
to
review
Secretary-General
Kofi
Annan
's
report
last
week,
in
which
he
outlined
goals
for
the
United
Nations
in
assisting
the
world's
most
under-developed
continent.
Annan
,
the
first
sub-Saharan
African
to
head
the
United
Nations
,
said
that
African
leaders
must
be
willing
to
combat
corruption,
protect
human
rights
and
pursue
sound
economic
policies.

the
same
time,
Annan
said,
the
international
community
must
respond
by
investing
in
Africa
and
by
intervening
to
end
armed
conflicts
and
restore
stability.

will
and
courage
is
very
much
needed
to
avoid

situations
in
which
the
United

is
unfortunately
seen
to
have
turned
its
back
on
the

people,
Monteiro
said.

measures
should
be
considered
to
ensure
that
the
United
Nations
and
the
Security
Council
in
particular
provide
a
timely
response
to
impending
crises.

the
council's
willingness
to
intervene
in
African
crises
was
weakened
by
the
disastrous
failure
of
the
U.N.
peacekeeping
operation
in
Somalia
.

deaths
of
18
American
soldiers
in
a
gun
battle
in
1993
led
the
United
States
to
withdraw
from
the
Somali
operation
and
impose
stringent
conditions
on
future
U.N.
peacekeeping
missions.
U.N.
officials
have
complained
those
conditions
have
made
it
nearly
impossible
for
the
United

to
respond

to
African
crises.

of

one

that

perhaps

the
U.N.
success
in

of
