SITES:
TUNING
INTO
MUSIC
ON
THE
WEB
Once
upon
a
time,
before
the
Internet
had
pictures
and
was
all
the
rage,
Quincy
Jones
,
the
music
impresario,
sat
with
Bill
Gates
,
the
computer
magnate,
at
a
technology
conference,
talking
about
the
future.

was
1992,
and
the
conversation
was
a
melding
of
the
two
titans'
respective
passions:
the
preservation
of
musical
cultures
and
the
nascent
online
universe
that
would
become
cyberspace.

took
six
years
to
realize
a
complete
fusion
of
the
vision
that
emerged
that
night.

Wednesday,
Jones
will
introduce
Qradio
,
a
venture
that
marries
the
Internet
to
his
advocacy
of
the
rich,
varied
and
largely
unknown
music
of
developing
nations.

radio,
a
technology
that
transmits
audio
programming
to
Internet-connected
personal
computers,
offers
the
potential
to
reach
a
wide
audience
at
a
fraction
of
the
cost
of
traditional
broadcasting.

a
different
sort
of
landscape,
a
21st-century
language,
Jones
said
of
the
Internet.

while
his
site
is
devoted
to
music,
unlike
broadcast
radio,
it
is
not
limited
to
sound.

it
is
a
multimedia
product
of
which
actual
radio
is
only
a
part.

is
being
formally

but
it
hopes
to
derive
revenue
from
the
sale
of
CDs
and
audio
tapes
marketed
by
means
of
online
music

Jones
and
his
partners
in
the
venture
say
they
hope
eventually
to
broaden
the
site
to
embrace
music
from
other
parts
of
Africa
,
as
well
as
from
the
Americas
.

it
could
serve
as
a
medium
for
breeding
new
species
of
music,
but
for
now,
Jones
suggests
that
the
goal
is
to
build
bridges
between
cultures
and
technological
classes.

Adam
Clayton
Powell
III
,
a
lifelong
friend
and
former
employee
of
Jones
,
said
the
seed
that
germinated
into
Qradio
was
a
1991

the

of

took
to
South

as
that

legacy
of

collapsing.

time,
Powell
said,
the
two
men
discussed
the
feasibility
of
a
cable
channel
to
promote
the
various
indigenous
musical
cultures
of
the
region,
but
the
costs
for
such
a
venture
were
prohibitive.

Powell
said,
the
notion
of
using
online

as
a

piqued
Jones

to

of
conflicting

use
by
small

some

that

would
permanently
deprive

governments
of
a
huge

in
theory,
covered
by

been
leading

would
remain

go
beyond

face

today,
Gale
said,
but
what
happens
to
local
tax
bases
when
the
Net
becomes
a
major
presence
in
retailing?
With
flat-out
opposition
to
the
Internet
legislation
no
longer
a
realistic
option
now
that
the
president
and
the
governors
of
New
York
,
California
and
Virginia
have
taken
a
stance
in
favor
of
the
Cox-Wyden
bill,
the
National
Governors'
Association
is
pressing
an
alternative.

by
Gov.
Michael
Leavitt
of
Utah
and
Gov.
Roy
Romer
of
Colorado
,
the
association
is
willing
to
accept
a
permanent
prohibition
on
taxing
access
to
the
Internet.

in
return,
it
wants
Washington
to
give
individual
states
a
powerful
incentive
to
create
a
single
consolidated
tax
on
out-of-state
purchases,
both
electronic
and
mail
order.

association's
proposal
would
override
the
Supreme
Court
ruling
by
requiring
large
vendors
to
collect
use
taxes
on
behalf
of
states
as
long
as
the
states
conformed
to
a
single
tax
structure.

is
the
time
for
a
system
that
creates
a
level
playing
filed
for
all
sellers,
Leavitt
said.

the
governors'
approach
faces
strong
opposition.

their
bill
would
meet
the
primary
objective
of
Internet
service
providers,
it
would
also
open
Internet
commerce
to
taxation.

see
this
as
a
new
tax
that
would
generate
$16
billion
in
revenue
by
the
year
2000,
Wyden
said.

more
important,
it
would
tie
Internet
tax
legislation
to
the
fate
of
the
states'
attempts
to
force
mail-order
vendors
to
collect
taxes
from
out-of-state
customers.

because
there
is
hardly
a
ground
swell
for
such
a
move
in
Congress
,
there
might
be
no
legislation
at
all
_
a
result
that
would
not
unduly
disturb
most
opponents
of
the
Internet
Tax
Freedom
Act.
The
governors,
it
is
generally
conceded,
are
playing
a
weak
political
hand.

House
leaders
are
promising
a
floor
vote
on
the
Cox-Wyden
bill
this
month.

last
week,
Senate

Leaser
Trent
Lott
,
R-
Miss.
,
predicted
that
the
bill
would
come
to
a
vote
in
the
Senate
by
May.
The
real
question,
then,
is
whether
the
governors
can
salvage
a
compromise
with
the
bill's
congressional
sponsors.

there
is
still
a

Leavitt
said.

SEARCH
ENGINE
THAT
CHARGES
FOR
TOP
BILLING
In
the
world
of
Internet
search
services,
finding
just
the
right
business
model
is
proving
as
elusive
as
finding
an
entirely
relevant
list
of

the
effort
can
be
seen
on
the
Web
sites
of
all
the
industry's
most
familiar
names.
Yahoo
,
the
biggest
of
the
dozens
of
sites
devoted
to
navigating
the
Web,
is
looking
more
like
a
commercial
online
service
every
day,
with
channels
that
organize
information
into
categories.

Excite
and
Lycos
have
also
added
chat
rooms,
electronic
mail
and
a
wide
range
of
original
content
like
news,
financial
services,
shopping
and
local
entertainment
guides.

this

are
making
a

into

as
they
do,
consumers
are
changing
the
way
they
use
them.

were
originally
developed
to
help
Internet
users
find
what
they
were
looking
for
among
the
millions
of
pages
on
the
World

and
as
such
they
were
judged
solely
by
how
well
_
and
how
quickly
_
they
matched

however,
searching
is
only
one
small
reason
people
go
to
sites
like
Yahoo

,
Infoseek

Jerry

of

The
rest
of
the

they
go
there
to
use
other
Yahoo

or
Yahoo

which
has
become
one
of
the
most
popular
financial

on
the

We
certainly
are
becoming
more
online

he
said.

that

make
our

however,
mean
visitors
to

like
Yahoo
and
Excite
tend
to
stay

and
potentially
do
more

if
the
site
offered

has
since
refocused
itself
toward
consumers
rather
than

Excite

last

though
analysts
appear
bullish
on
its
prospects.

while
Yahoo
and
others
are
trying
to
turn
their

an
ambitious
start-up
is
taking
an
entirely

Although
the

long

looked

A
DIRECTOR
WHO
DARES,
AND
TAKES
THE
HEAT
NEW
YORK
_
The
day
after
his
production
of
Lohengrin
received
a
hostile
reception
at
the
Metropolitan
Opera
,
Robert
Wilson
,
with
commitments
to
keep,
flew
to
Europe

telephone
from
Geneva
,
the
director
expressed
his
surprise
at
the
reaction,
and
tried
to
explain
the
reason
behind
it.

closed,
he
said.

regard
`Lohengrin'
as
19th-century
romanticism
and
want
to
guard
it.

made
it
clear
that
he
considered
Wagnerians
a
distinct
breed
of
classicists,
rigid
in
their
overprotectiveness.

that
opening-night
performance
last
week,
the
audience
enthusiastically
applauded
each
of
the
leading
singers
and
James
Levine
,
who
had
conducted
the
orchestra.

Levine
brought
Wilson
onstage,
and
there
was
a
sudden,
loud
chorus
of
boos,
echoing
through
the
opera
house.

who
were
applauding
clapped
harder,
and
there
were
a
few
lonely
bravos.

the
jeers
resoundingly
outnumbered
the
cheers.

a
second
round
of
bows,
the
response
was
the
same.

the
third
round,
Wilson
brought
his
costume
designer,
Frida
Parmeggiani
,
forward
with
him
(possibly
to
shield
himself
from
the
naysayers).

his
long
international
career
as
an
innovative
director
of
theater
and
opera,
Wilson
has
always
stirred
the
strongest
reactions.

in
Europe
,
he
is
regarded
as
an
icon
of
experimental
theater,
greeted
with
appreciative
cries
of
Bobwilson.

is
certainly
accustomed
to
criticism,
in
public
and
in
print,
but
the
Met
reception
was
excessive
and
extraordinarily
rude.

was
as
if
he
had
committed
a
crime
against
the
audience.
Wilson
said
that
standing
on
the
stage,
struck
by
a
wave
of
derision,
he
thought,
Wow!
wondering
what
had
provoked
such
a
visceral
response.

he
said:
I
didn't
do
anything
so
radical.

didn't
ask
the
singers
to
sing
upside
down.

he
did
was
to
strip
the
opera
of
its
romantic
trappings
and
present
it
in
an
abstract
modern
manner,
with
a
minimum
of
scenery
and
with
lighting
used
to
denote
both
environment
and
atmosphere.

the
singers,
a
shimmering
Rothko
-like
rectangle
changed
color
according
to
mood
and,
in
Wilson
's
signature
style,
bars
of
light,
both
horizontal
and
vertical,
were
substituted
for
traditional
woods
and
palaces.

back
at
the
beginning
of
the
project,
he
said
that
he
had
seen
a
photograph
of
a
production
of
Hamlet
in
which
the
ghost
was
an
ordinary
man
sitting
at
a
desk.

considered
the
possibility
of
staging
Lohengrin
in
a
similar
realistic
fashion.

inspired
by
Wagner
's
own
drawings,
he
began
to
see
the
stage
space
in
abstract
terms.

for
the
architecture
of
that
space,
he
decided
to
frame
the
opera
with
lighting
and
to
present
it
in
a
simple
way,
so
you
could
concentrate
on
the
music,
while
knowing
that
the
simplest
line
is
the
most
difficult.

the
same
time,
he
retained
Wagner
's
wing
of
a
swan
as
a
central
motif.

of
the
work's
mythic
elements
and
outsize
emotions,
he
said,
it
could
easily
be
made
to
seem
ridiculous:
If
I
did
the
opera
in
an
overly
theatrical
way,
that
would
diminish
the
music.

other
productions,
he
added,
Often
the
music
is
diminished.

all
costs,
he
wanted
to
help
the
Met
singers
feel
more
comfortable
on
stage
and
to
give
their
best
performances.

was
trying
to
be
respectful
to
the
text,
the
story
and
Wagner
,
he
said.

has
to
pay
respect
to
the
master,
but
one
has
to
be
careful
not
to
become
a
slave.

said
that
a
classic
should
not
be
rooted
in
a
single
time
or
place:
This
ancient
story
must
be
timeless.

must
be
present,
too.

Whether

him

take

her:

that
in

to
the

dance

are
able
to
approach
a
production
as
a
visual
art,
to
look
at
it
as
they
might
look
at

that
people
are
accustomed
to
seeing
Shakespeare
in
all
possible
situations:

continued
over

To
most
readers
today,
the
Bible
is
a
confusing
hodgepodge;
and
those
who
take
up
the
daunting
task
of
reading
it
from
cover
to
cover
seldom
maintain
their
resolve
beyond
a
book
or
two.

writes
Thomas
Cahill
in
his
captivating
new
book,
The
Gifts
of
the
Jews,
a
sequel
to
the
author's
best-selling
How
the
Irish
Saved
Civilization
and
the
second
book
in
his
projected
seven-volume
Hinges
of
History
series,
about
the
great
gift-givers
who
shaped
Western
civilization.

the
Bible
is
full
of
literature's
two
great
themes,
love
and
death
(as
well
as
its
exciting
caricatures,
sex
and
violence),
Cahill
continues,
it
is
also
full
of
tedious
ritual
prescriptions
and
interminable
battles.

than
anything,
because
the
Bible
is
the
product
of
so
many
hands
over
so
many
ages,
it
is
full
of
confusion
for
the
modern
reader
who
attempts
to
decode
what
it
might
be
about.

he
decodes
it
for
us,
the
Hebrew
Bible,
that
is,
comprising

(or
Teaching),
Neviim
(or
Prophets)
and
Ketuvim
(or
Writings).

former
director
of
religious
publishing
at
Doubleday
,
Cahill
skips
over
the
boring
parts
or
summarizes
their
implications;
he
skirts
much
scholarly
controversy;
he
simplifies
complex
questions
so
that
the
line
of
my
argument
may
appear
clearly;
he
writes
in
an
easy,
relaxed
vernacular.

he
enjoys
himself.

at
the
pharaoh
who
asks,
Ma-zot?
(What's
this?),
an
almost
comic
exclamation
of
frustration

Israel
,
when
he
learns
that
Sarah
(in
Genesis)
is
actually
not
Abraham

but
his
wife.

the
accessibility

King

Version
of
the
23rd
Psalm,

though

English-speaking

knows
it
by
heart.

the
reader
enjoys
himself,
too,
happy
to
have
gaps
filled
in,
amused
to
read
the
author's
snappy
summaries
of
obscure
occurrences,
edified
by
his
straightforward
interpretations
of
much-debated
episodes.

as
his
subtitle
conveys,
How
a
Tribe
of
Desert
Nomads
Change
the
Way
Everyone
Thinks
and
Feels,
Cahill
has
a
much
larger
purpose
here
than
simply
to
entertain.

he
sets
out
to
make
clear
is
that
when
Abraham
in
Genesis
heard
a
voice
telling
him
Go-you-forth/from
your
land,/from
your
kindred,/from
your
father's
house,/to
the
land
that
I
will
let
you
see,
something
new
in
history
was
happening,
a
migration
in
the
wrong
direction
that
would
change
the
face
of
the
earth
.

in
his
reading
of
the
Hebrew
Bible
he
not
only
traces
the
development
of
the
Hebrew
God
from
the
figure
who
heavy-handedly
called
for
the
near-sacrifice
of
Isaac
because
He
had
to
jump-start
this
new
religion,
and
He
didn't
always
have
the
best
material
to
work
with,
to
what
the
King
James
calls
the
still,
small
voice
that
the
Prophet
Elijah
heard.

also
contrasts
this
development
with
what
existed
before
Abraham
's
departure
for
Canaan
,
namely
what
the
author
describes
as
the
static
outlook
of
the
Mesopotamian
kingdom
of
Sumer
around
2000
B.C.,
which
conceived
of
time
as
a
turning
wheel
without
beginning
or
end.

section
on
Sumer
is
the
most
speculative
in
Cahill
's
book.

offering
up
Gilgamesh
as
an
epic
without
much
dramatic
development,
and
by
imagining
an
eerie
Moon
-cult
ritual
in
which
a
priestess
mounts
an
adolescent
boy,
he
is
more
or
less
asking
us
to
take
his
word
(and
that
of
the
pre-eminent
modern
scholar
of
religion,
Mircea
Eliade
)
that
the
Sumerians
lacked
any
sense
of
history.

the
timeless
atmosphere
he
evokes
certainly
contrasts
vividly
with
the
sharpness
of
the
Hebrew
imperative
lekh-lekha
(Go
forth)
and
the
phrase
wayyelekh
Avram
(
Abraham
went),
which
Cahill
calls
two
of
the
boldest
words
in
all
of
literature.

what
matters,
after
all,
are
the
events
after
Abraham
's
departure.

the
thesis
of
The
Gifts
of
the
Jews
stand
up,
persuading
us
that
the
Israelites
changed
history?
As
readers
of
How
the
Irish
Saved
Civilization
will
recall,
Cahill
is
fond
of
hyperbole.

one
might
take
it
with
a
grain
of
salt
when
he
writes
of
the
Old
Testament
Jews
that
it
may
be
said
with
some
justice
that
theirs
is
the
only
new
idea
that
human
beings
have
ever
had,
or
We
can
hardly
get
up
in
the
morning
or
cross
the
street
without
being
Jewish.

too,
he
seems
to
be
chiding
anti-Semites,
of
whom
he
writes:
The
hatred
of
Christians
for
Jews
may
have
its
ultimate
source
in
hatred
of
God
,
a
hatred
that
the
hater
must
carefully
keep
himself
from
knowing
about.

The
Gifts
of
the
Jews
is
finally
persuasive
as
well
as
entertaining.

are
the
Sumerians,
the
Babylonians,
the
Assyrians
today?
he
asks,
remarking
on
Jewish
identity
and
the
unique
miracle
of
cultural
survival.

Jews
gave
us
the
Outside
and
the
Inside
_
our
outlook
and
our
inner
life,
he
concludes.

Jewish
dreams
and
hope
Jewish

our
best
words,
in
fact
_
new,
adventure,
surprise;
unique,
individual,
person,
vocation;
time,
history,
future;
freedom,

_
are
gifts
of
the
Jews.

so
is
Cahill
's
book
a
gift.
