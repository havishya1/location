_ O
In O
a O
town O
famous O
for O
its O
flamboyance, O
Susan O
Spicer O
is O
the O
city's O
stealth O
chef. O

Emeril O
Legasse O
or O
Justin O
Wilson O
, O
she O
speaks O
softly, O
has O
no O
desire O
to O
build O
a O
restaurant O
empire O
and O
serves O
neither O
Cajun O
nor O
Creole O
food. O

if O
she O
is O
quiet O
and O
self-deprecating, O
the O
food O
at O
her O
restaurant, O
Bayona I-LOCATION
, O
shines, O
and O
she O
is O
widely O
regarded O
as O
one O
of O
the O
cooking O
luminaries O
of O
New I-LOCATION
Orleans I-LOCATION
, O
and O
of O
the O
nation O
as O
well, O
as O
she O
is O
routinely O
cited O
in O
surveys O
of O
America I-LOCATION
's O
best O
chefs. O

intimate O
restaurant O
in O
the O
French I-LOCATION
Quarter I-LOCATION
is O
packed O
nightly O
with O
locals O
as O
well O
as O
tourists O
who O
appreciate O
her O
uncluttered O
cooking, O
which O
relies O
on O
the O
goodness O
of O
the O
ingredients O
and O
her O
captivating O
approach. O

food O
reflects O
her O
wide-ranging O
interests: O
She O
has O
lived O
in O
France I-LOCATION
and O
Holland I-LOCATION
, O
and O
has O
traveled O
throughout O
most O
of O
the O
Mediterranean I-LOCATION
and O
the O
United I-LOCATION
States I-LOCATION
. O

her O
mother, O
who O
is O
Danish, O
she O
learned O
variety. O

was O
as O
likely O
to O
serve O
fried O
chicken O
as O
curry, O
Ms. O
Spicer O
said. O

some O
of O
Ms. O
Spicer O
's O
food O
also O
mirrors O
a O
Louisiana I-LOCATION
sensibility. O

uses O
oysters O
to O
stuff O
roasted O
quail, O
and O
encrusts O
rabbit O
with O
pecans O
and O
serves O
it O
with O
a O
sauce O
made O
from O
Cajun O
tasso O
ham. O

Thai O
spicy O
shrimp, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
is O
brilliantly O
seasoned O
and O
authentically O
Thai, O
with O
beautifully O
balanced O
flavors. O

presentations O
are O
simple O
and O
straightforward. O

towers O
of O
food O
and O
other O
show-off O
architecture. O

came O
quickly O
to O
Ms. O
Spicer O
when O
she O
opened O
her O
own O
restaurant O
in O
1990, O
but O
it O
was O
not O
before O
years O
of O
casting O
about O
for O
a O
career. O

Spicer O
, O
45, O
considers O
herself O
a O
late O
bloomer. O

claims O
to O
have O
failed O
at O
everything O
else O
she O
tried. O

was O
a O
cocktail O
waitress, O
and O
I O
was O
fired, O
and O
I O
was O
a O
bad O
secretary, O
she O
said, O
a O
small O
smile O
playing O
around O
her O
mouth. O

I O
could O
be O
considered O
a O
change-of-career O
person O
if O
I O
had O
ever O
had O
a O
career. O

was O
a O
child O
of O
the O
60s, O
and O
I O
was O
restless. O

started O
cooking O
at O
26, O
but O
I O
was O
always O
looking O
for O
a O
creative O
outlet. O

came O
easy. O

began O
her O
culinary O
career O
in O
1979 O
by O
apprenticing O
herself O
to O
a O
French O
chef O
in O
New I-LOCATION
Orleans I-LOCATION
. O

she O
spent O
four O
months O
working O
at O
all O
the O
stations O
in O
a O
Parisian O
restaurant O
kitchen, O
knowing O
that O
when O
she O
returned O
to O
New I-LOCATION
Orleans I-LOCATION
her O
boss O
expected O
her O
to O
become O
the O
chef O
of O
a O
restaurant O
he O
was O
opening. O

said O
she O
didn't O
feel O
she O
was O
qualified, O
but O
the O
decision O
was O
out O
of O
her O
hands. O

a O
chef O
when O
I O
felt O
I O
wasn't O
ready O
was O
pretty O
stressful, O
she O
said. O

I O
hired O
I O
thought O
knew O
more O
than O
I O
did. O

was O
really O
kind O
of O
afraid O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
time. O

I O
left O
and O
went O
back O
to O
Europe I-LOCATION
and O
worked O
here O
and O
there. O

returned O
to O
New I-LOCATION
Orleans I-LOCATION
a O
year O
later O
and, O
in O
1986, O
was O
the O
opening O
chef O
at O
the O
Bistro I-LOCATION
in O
the O
Maison I-LOCATION
de I-LOCATION
Ville I-LOCATION
hotel I-LOCATION
, O
where O
she O
stayed O
until O
Bayona I-LOCATION
became O
a O
reality. O

was O
an O
immediate O
success, O
turning O
a O
profit O
within O
six O
months. O

though O
Bayona I-LOCATION
has O
a O
national O
reputation O
among O
the O
cognoscenti, O
and O
even O
though O
she O
feels O
pretty O
confident O
about O
what O
she O
is O
doing, O
Ms. O
Spicer O
thinks O
she O
has O
a O
long O
way O
to O
go. O
Bayona I-LOCATION
is O
still O
evolving, O
she O
said, O
on O
a O
recent O
afternoon O
as O
she O
cooked O
some O
of O
her O
favorite O
dishes O
in O
the O
cooking-school O
kitchen O
of O
her O
shop, O
which O
she O
recently O
opened. O

have O
to O
stay O
fresh. O

want O
to O
keep O
it O
that O
way. O

don't O
think O
I O
have O
enough O
energy O
to O
inject O
into O
five O
different O
projects. O

is O
determined O
to O
keep O
growing O
as O
a O
cook. O

of O
the O
things O
I'm O
good O
at O
is O
putting O
flavors O
together, O
she O
said. O

have O
good O
instincts O
about O
food O
and O
wine, O
probably O
from O
being O
adventurous O
at O
a O
very O
young O
age. O

can O
sit O
in O
my O
office O
and O
put O
a O
menu O
together. O

in O
terms O
of O
technique, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
be O
more O
confident. O

Spicer O
, O
who O
has O
dark O
blond O
hair O
and O
intense O
pale O
blue O
eyes, O
describes O
herself O
as O
shy, O
but O
she O
does O
not O
go O
unnoticed: O
people O
always O
remember O
her O
because O
of O
the O
band O
she O
wears O
across O
her O
forehead O
when O
she O
cooks. O

of O
course, O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
reporter, O
when O
the O
headband O
moves O
to O
the O
back O
of O
her O
hair, O
and O
any O
leftover O
hippie O
traits O
are O
disguised. O

who O
have O
seen O
her O
conduct O
a O
cooking O
class O
describe O
her O
as O
lively O
and O
funny, O
sharing O
intimate O
secrets O
of O
her O
private O
life, O
talking O
about O
her O
younger O
boyfriend, O
for O
example, O
who O
is O
also O
the O
manager O
of O
her O
shop. O

describes O
this O
mingling O
of O
her O
personal O
and O
professional O
lives O
as O
a O
pretty O
dangerous O
thing O
to O
do, O
adding O
in O
an O
offhanded O
manner O
that O
she O
is O
past O
the O
point O
of O
worrying O
about O
getting O
married. O

Spicer O
came O
to O
cooking O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
father O
and O
because O
of O
her O
mother. O

dad O
had O
really O
high O
hopes O
for O
me O
scholastically, O
she O
said. O

did O
well O
in O
school. O

skipped O
a O
grade O
when O
I O
was O
a O
kid, O
and O
he O
wanted O
me O
to O
be O
some O
sort O
of O
engineer, O
something O
less O
earthy O
than O
a O
cook. O

wanted O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Culinary I-LOCATION
Institute I-LOCATION
of I-LOCATION
America I-LOCATION
, O
but O
he O
didn't O
want O
to O
pay O
for O
it. O

the O
lack O
of O
the O
architectural O
plates O
that O
are O
so O
in O
vogue O
today, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food O
is O
neither O
Cajun O
nor O
Creole O
and O
that O
the O
chef O
does O
not O
have O
a O
television O
cooking O
series, O
not O
even O
a O
cookbook, O
Ms. O
Spicer O
's O
patrons O
have O
come O
to O
trust O
her. O

think O
we O
keep O
it O
interesting O
enough O
without O
intimidating O
people, O
she O
said. O

Spicer O
's O
understated O
style O
is O
apparent, O
too, O
in O
the O
look O
of O
her O
new O
shop O
called O
Spice I-LOCATION
Inc. I-LOCATION
: O
clean O
and O
spare. O

shop O
is O
taking O
off, O
even O
though O
its O
location O
makes O
Ms. O
Spicer O
an O
urban O
pioneer. O

opened O
late O

Cotton O

no O
clue O
to O
her O
airy O
shop O

Ms. O

said. O

not O
look O
more O
different O
from O

for O
all O
its O
charm, O
it O
is O
as O
understated O
as O
the O
owner. O

not O
looking O
to O
provoke, O
Ms. O
Spicer O
said. O

not O
an O
envelope-pusher. O

glad O
there O
are O
people O
who O
do O
that, O
but O
essentially O
I O
just O
want O
it O
to O
taste O
good. O

MIRROR O

OF O
MARTIN O
LUTHER O
KING O
Charles O
Johnson O
, O
whose O
last O
novel, O
Middle O
Passage O
was O
a O
historical O
reconstruction O
of O
slavery, O
has O
turned O
to O
more O
recent O
history O
in O
Dreamer, O
an O
imagined O
account O
of O
the O
last O
days O
of O
the O
Rev. O
Dr. O
Martin O
Luther O
King O
Jr. O
They O
are O
days O
filled O
with O
evil O
premonitions O
of O
the O
tragedy O
that O
was O
to O
strike O
when O
King O
was O
assassinated O
in O
Memphis I-LOCATION
, O
Tenn. I-LOCATION
, O
30 O
years O
ago. O

story O
shifts O
from O
King O
's O
interior O
monologues O
to O
the O
reflections O
of O
Johnson O
's O
principal O
narrator, O
a O
shy, O
self-conscious O
24-year-old O
acolyte O
of O
King O
named O
Matthew O
Bishop O
who, O
in O
the O
words O
of O
the O
woman O
he O
loves, O
talks O
like O
a O
thesaurus. O

of O
Johnson O
's O
themes O
is O
Matthew O
's O
growth O
from O
a O
kind O
of O
intellectually O
precocious O
late O
adolescence O
to O
full O
manhood; O
indeed, O
one O
suspects O
that O
Matthew O
is O
modeled O
on O
Johnson O
's O
youthful O
self. O

Johnson O
's O
narrative O
is O
aimed O
principally O
at O
the O
appearance O
of O
an O
entirely O
fictional O
character, O
Chaym O
Smith O
, O
a O
global O
wanderer O
and O
striver O
after O
redemption O
who O
bears O
an O
uncanny O
physical O
resemblance O
to O
King O
. O

a O
result, O
Chaym O
earns O
a O
role O
as O
a O
stand-in O
for O
King O
at O
a O
time O
when O
his O
life O
was O
clearly O
in O
danger. O

Chaym O
's O
presence O
gives O
Johnson O
's O
novel O
the O
ambiguous, O
Conradian O
eeriness O
of O
all O
stories O
about O
the O
doppelganger, O
the O
double, O
the O
mirror O
image O
and O
the O
opposite, O
the O
reminder O
of O
the O
invisible O
person O
who O
lies O
behind O
the O
mask. O

themes O
are O
rich, O
and O
they O
are O
developed O
by O
Johnson O
with O
his O
usual O
stylishness. O

has O
lived O
his O
life O
shadowed O
by O
King O
's O
fame O
and O
his O
status O
as O
a O
kind O
of O
living O
saint. O

Johnson O
's O
vision, O
that O
experience O
has O
made O
him O
both O
jealous O
and O
driven, O
admiring O
and O
vengeful. O
Johnson O
reminds O
us O
that O
King O
was O
a O
minister O
as O
well O
as O
a O
leader O
of O
the O
struggle O
for O
black O
rights, O
and O
Dreamer O
is O
full O
of O
theological O
reflections. O

biblical O
story O
of O
Cain O
, O
whose O
sacrifice O
was O
rather O
inexplicably O
rejected O
by O
God O
, O
resounds O
through O
the O
novel O
as O
Chaym O
asks O
why O
he O
has O
been O
cursed O
even O
as O
blessings O
pour O
down O
on O
King O
. O

was O
my O
stuff, O
Chaym O
tells O
Matthew O
after O
the O
two O
of O
them O
have O
listened O
to O
King O
speak O
at O
a O
church. O

things O
I've O
ever O
said, O
but O
stuff O
I've O
felt. O

my O
spirit O
is O
trapped O
in O
his, O
which O
is O
so O
much O
clearer O
and O
bigger O
and O
cleaner. O

other O
words, O
there O
are O
numerous O
folds O
to O
Johnson O
's O
psychological O
intrigue. O

himself O
is O
a O
powerful O
character, O
eloquently O
irascible, O
morally O
deep. O

yet O
Dreamer O
is O
not O
a O
complete O
success, O
despite O
the O
consistently O
high O
quality O
of O
Johnson O
's O
writing. O

the O
end O
especially, O
Johnson O
seems O
to O
lose O
control O
of O
his O
doppelganger O
theme. O

Dreamer O
turns O
to O
a O
muddled O
theme O
of O
betrayal O
involving O
an O
unlikely O
pair O
of O
federal O
agents O
and O
Chaym O
. O

betrayal O
seems, O
at O
least O
by O
virtue O
of O
its O
timing, O
linked O
to O
King O
's O
assassination, O
though O
this O
is O
far O
from O
clear. O

is O
as O
though O
Johnson O
himself O
did O
not O
know O
quite O
what O
to O
do O
with O
the O
forces O
he O
has O
set O
into O
motion. O

recourse O
to O
a O
kind O
of O
unresolved O
and O
implausible O
mystery O
leaves O
the O
reader O
with O
a O
sense O
of O
incompleteness, O
anticlimax. O

while O
that O
might O
be O
an O
intentional O
reflection O
of O
the O
deeper O
incompleteness O
of O
real O
life, O
a O
lesson O
in O
the O
unresolvability O
of O
things O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
have O
been O
Johnson O
's O
purpose. O

CAN O
END O
HERE O
_ O
OPTIONAL O
MATERIAL O
FOLLOWS) O
The O
action O
of O
Dreamers O
takes O
place O
mostly O
in O
Chicago I-LOCATION
, O
where O
King O
, O
having O
achieved O
major O
victories O
in O
the O
South, O
has O
arrived O
to O
campaign O
against O
Northern O
forms O
of O
racial O
discrimination. O
Johnson O
's O
King O
is O
tired O
and O
tearful O
and O
assailed O
by O
doubts. O

wonders O
in O
particular O
if O
he O
has O
overestimated O
the O
spiritual O
capacity O
of O
blacks O
and O
whites O
alike, O
whether O
they O
are O
capable O
of O
understanding O
his O
deeper, O
esoteric O
message O
about O
freedom, O
namely O
that O
to O
gain O
the O
dizzying O
heights O
of O
the O
mountaintop, O
the O
self's O
baggage O
had O
to O
be O
abandoned O
in O
the O
valley. O
Chaym O
Smith O
arrives O
at O
King O
's O
door O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
these O
ruminations. O

was O
the O
kind O
of O
Negro O
the O
movement O
had O
for O
years O
kept O
away O
from O
the O
world's O
cameras, O
Matthew O
says O
of O
Chaym O
's O
appearance: O
sullen, O
ill-kept, O
the O
very O
embodiment O
of O
the O
blues. O
Chaym O
volunteers O
to O
be O
King O
's O
stand-in, O
a O
role O
he O
has O
been O
unhappily O
playing O
most O
of O
his O
life O
anyway. O

King O
refuses, O
Chaym O
tells O
him, O
I O
figure O
if O
I'm O
catchin' O
hell O
'cause O
of O
you, O
I O
might's O
well O
catch O
it O
for O
you O
instead. O

agrees O
to O
arrange O
training O
for O
the O
destitute O
Chaym O
so O
he O
can O
be O
part O
of O
the O
movement, O
and O
he O
assigns O
Matthew O
and O
Amy O
, O
the O
unreciprocating O
object O
of O
Matthew O
's O
desire, O
to O
take O
care O
of O
him. O

story O
unfolds O
against O
a O
background O
of O
increasing O
urban O
violence O
and O
challenges O
to O
King O
from O
younger, O
more O
militant O
blacks O
within O
the O
ranks. O

in O
this O
sense O
takes O
on O
a O
time-capsule O
flavor. O

is O
sometimes O
contrived, O
for O
example, O
when O
Amy O
and O
Matthew O
find O
themselves O
berated O
as O
house O
niggers O
by O
an O
ex-con O
named O
Yahya O
Zubena O
who O
has O
found O
poetry O
and O
black O
power O
in O
prison. O

the O
main O
character O
remains O
Chaym O
, O
whose O
homophonic O
resemblance O
to O
Cain O
is O
made O
explicit O
as O
Johnson O
returns O
again O
and O
again O
to O
his O
biblical O
theme. O

began O
to O
see O
_ O
as O
if O
a O
veil O
had O
lifted O
_ O
the O
tortured O
shadow O
of O
Cain O
everywhere, O
within O
me O
and O
without, O
his O
many O
cultural O
reincarnations O
parading O
through O
my O
mind O
like O
frames O
projected O
on O
a O
cyclorama, O
Matthew O
tells O
us. O

was O
said O
that O
Western O
man O
himself O
was O
Cain O
, O
cursed O
with O
the O
burden O
of O
restlessness O
and O
the O
endless O
quest O
for O
selfhood. O

through O
the O
centuries, O
his O
name O
was O
spelled O
differently O
in O
different O
times. O

, O
Kaym O
, O
even O
Chaym O
, O
were O
etymological O
variations O
on O
it. O

Chaym O
, O
King O
's O
double, O
is O
Cain O
, O
but O
he O
is O
everyman O
as O
well, O
within O
and O
without. O

the O
end, O
Chaym O
, O
asked O
by O
a O
pair O
of O
rather O
woodenly O
constructed O
FBI I-LOCATION
men O
to O
turn O
from O
double O
to O
double O
agent, O
disappears. O

after, O
King O
is O
assassinated. O
Johnson O
seems O
to O
be O
saying O
something O
about O
the O
collective O
failure O
to O
climb O
to O
the O
mountaintop O
as O
well O
as O
collective O
responsibility O
for O
King O
's O
death. O

is O
no O
doubt O
true, O
but O
it O
is O
also O
a O
nostrum, O
a O
commonplace O
sort O
of O
wisdom. O

it O
is O
unmoored O
from O
the O
deeply O
personal O
and O
individual O
mystery O
that O
Chaym O
presented O
at O
the O
outset. O

back O
two O
seasons O
ago, O
the O
production O
was O
even O
more O
humane, O
and O
Levine O

conducting O
more O
luminous. O

Meistersinger O
returned O
on O
Monday O
night. O

original O
reason O
for O
bringing O
it O
back O
was O
that O
the O
great O
bass O
James O
Morris O
was O
planning O
to O
sing O
his O
first O
Hans O
Sachs O
, O
one O
of O
opera's O
longest O
roles, O
Wagner O
's O
wise O
shoemaker, O
a O
widower O
in O
medieval O
Nurnberg I-LOCATION
and O
the O
most O
beloved O
member O
of O
the O
town's O
guild O
of O
master O
singers. O

Morris O
withdrew O
last O
fall, O
and O
the O
Met I-LOCATION
had O
to O
come O
up O
fast O
with O
a O
replacement. O

James O
Johnson O
, O
an O
American O
bass O
making O
his O
house O
debut, O
the O
company O
had O
a O
creditable O
Sachs O
. O

Levine O
's O
intricate O
and O
organic O
work O
seemed O
even O
deeper O
this O
time O
around. O

orchestra O
playing O
on O
Monday O
positively O
glowed. O

onstage O
there O
was O
a O
sense O
of O
a O
production O
thrown O
together O
and O
lacking O
inspiration, O
and O
the O
likely O
cause O
was O
the O
jokey O
and O
intrusively O
busy O
stage O
direction O
of O
David O
McClintock O
. O

Meistersinger O
is O
a O
comedy, O
but O
a O
tender, O
insightful O
and, O
at O
times, O
troubling O
comedy, O
not O
the O
antic O
fest O
it O
sometimes O
seemed O
here. O

for O
example, O
the O
depiction O
of O
Beckmesser O
, O
the O
town O
clerk. O
Beckmesser O
may O
be O
laughable, O
but O
he O
must O
be O
endearingly O
laughable. O

dream O
of O
marrying O
Eva O
, O
the O
daughter O
of O
his O
fellow O
master O
singer O
Pogner O
, O
by O
winning O
the O
guild's O
annual O
song O
contest, O
and O
his O
scheming O
to O
outmaneuver O
Sachs O
show O
him O
to O
be O
hapless, O
not O
nasty O
or O
stupid. O
Hans-Joachim O
Ketelsen O
, O
the O
German O
baritone, O
sang O
the O
role O
splendidly O
but O
was O
not O
helped O
by O
the O
stage O
direction. O

his O
nighttime O
serenade O
to O
Eva O
is O
mischievously O
interrupted O
by O
Sachs O
' O
cobbling, O
a O
pouting O
Beckmesser O
struts O
about O
the O
street O
in O
circles, O
his O
hands O
linked O
behind O
his O
back, O
a O
cartoonish O
and O
cliched O
idea. O

aches O
and O
pains O
he O
suffers O
from O
the O
town O
brawl O
set O
off O
by O
his O
serenading O
were O
inanely O
overacted. O

from O
the O
directorial O
slips, O
there O
were O
some O
vocal O
rewards, O
especially O
from O
the O
musicianly O
tenor O
Ben O
Heppner O
, O
who O
had O
a O
triumphant O
evening O
reprising O
the O
daunting O
role O
of O
the O
young O
knight O
Walther O
. O

voice O
sounded O
rested, O
free O
and O
thrilling. O

has O
a O
sturdy O
though O
not O
exceptional O
voice, O
and O
stamina. O

could O
have O
projected O
more O
of O
Sachs O
' O
dignity O
had O
he O
not O
been O
directed O
to O
act O
like O
a O
bully, O
shoving O
Beckmesser O
around O
at O
will, O
and O
flinging O
Eva O
at O
Walther O
(three O
times!), O
which O
the O
fatherly O
Sachs O
would O
never O
do. O
Eva O
Johansson O
, O
a O
Danish O
soprano O
making O
her O
Met I-LOCATION
debut, O
made O
a O
lovely O
Eva O
, O
but O
the O
girlishness O
of O
her O
characterization O
was O
too O
aggressively O
projected, O
and O
at O
full O
volume O
her O
voice O
tended O
to O
turn O
harsh O
and O
wobbly. O

Danish O
tenor O
Gert O
Henning-Jensen O
made O
his O
debut O
as O
Sachs O
' O
apprentice, O
David O
, O
and O
with O
his O
boyish O
looks O
and O
balletic O
agility O
he O
looked O
the O
part. O

his O
voice O
was O
hard O
pressed O
in O
places. O

White O
was O
sympathetic O
as O
Magdalene O
, O
and O
Hans O
Sotin O
was O
a O
stentorian O
Pogner O
. O

amassed O
sound O
of O
the O
Met I-LOCATION
chorus O
greeting O
Sachs O
in O
the O
final O
scene O
will O
not O
be O
easily O
forgotten. O

only O
the O
antics O
of O
the O
stage O
direction O
could O
be O
cleaned O
up. O

almost O
makes O
you O
long O
for O
Robert O
Wilson O

the O

Jacobson O
says. O

he O
added, O

OPTIONAL O
MATERIAL O

Every O
book O
ever O
published O
in O
a O
single O
volume? O
The O
mind O
boggles O
and O
a O
dozen O
questions O
form. O

this O
really O
happen? O
How O
soon O
could O
the O
last O
book O
be O
available? O
A O
prototype O
with O
just O
a O
few O
pages O
could O
be O
put O
together O
in O
two O
to O
three O
years, O
with O
one O
of O
400 O
pages O
taking O
a O
year O
or O
two O
longer, O
Jacobson O
said. O

should O
be O
pointed O
out O
that O
two O
years O
ago, O
in O
a O
description O
of O
his O
project O
published O
by O
the O
Media I-LOCATION
Lab I-LOCATION
, O
Jacobson O
stated O
that O
a O
prototype O
would O
be O
available O
in O
about O
two O
years, O
meaning O
1998. O

I O
actually O
saw O
at O
the O
Media I-LOCATION
Lab I-LOCATION
did O
not O
approach O
even O
one O
page.) O
We O
have O
already O
demonstrated O
the O
fundamental O
new O
parts O
needed O
to O
make O
it, O
Jacobson O
continued. O

there O
are O
many O
different O
projects O
that O
can O
be O
enabled O
by O
this O
underpinning O
technology, O
exactly O
when O
it O
will O
be O
combined O
to O
form O
a O
book O
is O
not O
yet O
clear. O

an O
important O
point O
is O
that O
these O
are O
technologies O
that O
are O
easily O
manufactured O
and O
not O
phenomenally O
expensive. O

much O
will O
it O
cost O
then? O
Jacobson O
says O
the O
volume O
will O
probably O
retail O
for O
$2 O
to O
$4 O
per O
reusable O
page, O
or O
$500 O
to O
$1,000 O
for O
a O
book O
that O
is O
every O
book, O
although O
he O
is O
working O
on O
ways O
to O
reduce O
costs O
even O
further. O

would O
be O
nice O
to O
have O
a O
cost O
so O
low O
that O
you O
could O
lose O
the O
book O
without O
worrying O
about O
it O
too O
much, O
he O
added. O

believe O
that O
will O
be O
possible. O

about O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
contents? O
Books O
in O
the O
public O
domain O
could O
be O
downloaded O
for O
nothing, O
Jacobson O
says. O

new O
works O
and O
books O
still O
in O
copyright, O
a O
system O
of O
royalties O
could O
be O
set O
up O
in O
which O
texts O
would O
be O
encrypted O
and O
readers O
would O
buy O
the O
access O
code O
by O
Internet, O
phone O
or O
wireless O
transaction. O

questions O
remain O
unanswered. O

are O
the O
implications O
for O
the O
publishing O
industry? O
Already O
any O
writer O
can O
post O
a O
book O
on O
the O
Internet. O

books O
will O
still O
need O
to O
be O
edited O
and O
promoted. O

It O
looks O
as O
if O
they O
won't, O
unless, O
like O
me, O
you O
will O
still O
insist O
on O
having O
certain O

to O
remind O
you O
of O
their O
existence O
and O
your O
promise O
to O
yourself O
to O
read O
them O
some O
day. O

likes O
of O
us O
will O
have O
to O
keep O
on O
collecting O
old-fashioned O
books. O

maybe O
resort O
to O
displaying O
those O
Potemkin O

on O
our O

rows O
and O

of O
our O

one O

officials O
at O
the O

the O
closing O

Smithsonian I-LOCATION
Institution I-LOCATION
spokesman, O
Linda O
St. O
Thomas O
said O
on O
Tuesday O
that O
the O
Smithsonian I-LOCATION
would O
like O
to O
find O
a O
way O
to O
continue O
some O
of O
the O
recording O
functions, O
but O
that O
it O
was O
too O
early O
to O
tell O
in O
what O
form O
and O
to O
what O
degree O
that O
might O
play O
out. O

said O
the O
decisions O
were O
made O
against O
the O
backdrop O
both O
of O
the O
financial O
needs O
of O
the O
Smithsonian I-LOCATION
and O
the O
changes O
in O
the O
marketplace O
that O
have O
buffeted O
many O
direct-mail O
operations. O

understanding O
is O
that O
as O
the O
direct-mail O
environment O
has O
eroded O
overall O
for O
all O
businesses, O
those O
projects O
became O
more O
and O
more O
difficult O
to O
sustain, O
said O
Peter O
Cannell O
, O
director O
of O
the O
Smithsonian I-LOCATION
Institution I-LOCATION

, O
the O
surviving O

said O
employees O
at O
the O
Smithsonian I-LOCATION
viewed O
the O
cutbacks O
with O
conflicting O
feelings. O

a O
decision O
that O
is O
in O
some O
ways O
sorry O
to O
see, O
he O
said. O

on O
the O
other O
hand, O
any O
business O
or O
institution O
has O
to O
be O
able O
to O
change O
with O
the O

that's O
what O
we're O

for O
a O

that O

up O
from O
Wednesday O
in O
response O
to O

Trimble O
said O
a O
set O
of O

given O
to O
the O
negotiating O

early O
Tuesday O
was O
unacceptable, O
a O
rejection O
that O
was O
widely O
seen O
as O
a O
melodramatic O
tactic O
to O
take O
the O
initiative O
in O
peace O

the O
tactic O
could O
backfire O
and O
push O
the O
talks O
to O
the O
brink O
of O
a O
collapse, O
which O
would O
probably O
turn O
the O
melodrama O
into O
the O
tragedy O
of O
widespread O
violence O
by O
the O
main O
Catholic O

Protestant O
guerrilla O
groups, O
which O
are O
now O
observing O

Tuesday O

that O
the O

that O
his O

advanced O
by O
Trimble O
, O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
Protestant O
Ulster I-LOCATION

. O
Trimble O
said O
the O
proposals, O
which O
were O
put O
forward O
by O
Mitchell O
and O
have O
not O
been O
made O
public, O
were O
biased O
in O

of O
the O
two O

. O
Blair O
sought O
to O
reassure O
Protestants O
by O
noting O
that O
it O
was O

policy O
that O
there O
will O
be O
no O

well O
into O
the O

Trimble O
makes O
his O
own O
proposals O
in O
the O
next O
two O

the O
predictable O
reaction O
would O
be O
rejection O
by O
Sinn I-LOCATION

possibly O
the O

Prime O

Bertie O
Ahern O
, O
while O

in O
a O
new O

bristle O

for O

office, O
Trimble O
said, O
he O
said O
of O
the O
Mitchell O

Before O
contemplating O
alternate O
proposals, O
I O
wish O
to O
know O
from O
you O
and O
the O
Irish O
government O
if O
you O
are O
prepared O
to O
consider O
radically O
different O
measures. O

principal O
Protestant O
complaint O
with O
the O
Irish O
government, O
a O
sponsor O
of O
the O
talks O
with O
Britain I-LOCATION
, O
is O
that O
the O
Irish O
have O
refused O
to O
specify O
how O
they O
would O
tone O
down O
Ireland I-LOCATION
's O
constitutional O
claim O

in O

Ahern O
, O
who O
was O
in O
Dublin I-LOCATION
on O

for O

funeral, O
did O
not O
immediately O
comment O
on O
Trimble O
's O
rejection O
of O
the O
Mitchell O
proposals. O

rejection O
was O
partly O
motivated O
by O
Trimble O

need O
to O
stave O
off O
the O
vehement O
criticism O
by O
the O
Rev. O
Ian O
Paisley O
, O
who O
has O
kept O
his O
Democratic I-LOCATION
Unionist I-LOCATION
Party I-LOCATION
out O
of O
the O

Trimble O
was O
stating O
his O
rejection, O
Paisley O
was O
haranguing O
him O
in O
television O
interviews O
as O
a O
traitor O
who O
was O
selling O
out O
to O
Catholic O
terrorists. O

and O
Paisley O
compete O
for O
Protestant O
votes O
in O
general O

a O
new O
northern O

Trimble O
would O
be O
a O
likely O
candidate O
for O

stunts, O
said O
Seamus O
Mallon O

HUMBLE O
PENNY O
WHISTLE O
FLIRTS O
WITH O
OVERKILL O
I O
used O
to O
love O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
penny O
whistle. O

a O
well-nigh O
perfect O
instrument: O
portable, O
cheap, O
and O
low-tech, O
with O
no O
moving O
parts. O

easy O
to O
play O
yet O
capable O
of O
great O
subtlety; O
a O
skillful O
player O
can O
make O
notes O
bend O
and O
quiver O
and O
sigh. O

it O
immediately O
invokes O
a O
long O
and O
precious O
tradition. O

penny O
whistle O
and O
tin O
whistle, O
with O
or O
without O
a O
mouthpiece, O
provide O
one O
of O
the O
primal O
sounds O
of O
Celtic O
music, O
plaintive O
in O
slow O
airs O
and O
dizzyingly O
nimble O
in O
dance O
tunes. O

a O
musician O
pulls O
a O
whistle O
out O
of O
a O
pocket O
and O
joins O
in O
a O
melody, O
it's O
a O
surviving O
link O
to O
centuries O
of O
homemade O
music. O

now O
it O
is O
my O
regretful O
duty O
to O
propose O
a O
ban O
on O
penny O
whistle O
use O
anywhere O
outside O
a O
Guinness I-LOCATION

effective O
immediately. O

sweet O
sound O
is O
on O
the O
verge O
of O
curdling, O
and O
it O
is O
time O
to O
save O
it O
from O
overexposure. O

won't O
be O
any O
immediate O
hardship. O

I O
heard O
a O
tin O
whistle O
tootling O
through O
a O
blues, O
Broken O
Hearted, O
on O
Eric O
Clapton O
's O
new O
album, O
Pilgrim, O
it O
suddenly O
became O
clear: O
the O
whistle O
is O
becoming O
the O
trendy O
sonic O
accessory O
of O
the O
late O
1990s. O

happens O
to O
instruments, O
and O
it's O
not O
a O
pretty O
process. O

happened O
to O
the O
sitar O
(and O
then O
the O
electric O
sitar), O
to O
the O
Cajun O
accordion O
and O
to O
panpipes. O

are O
all O
now O
tainted O
by O
their O
abuse O
at O
the O
hands O
of O
everyone O
from O
hippie O
bands O
to O
horror O
movie O
auteurs. O

from O
their O
ethnic O
enclaves, O
the O
instruments' O
masters O
revel O
in O
their O
new-found O
prominence. O

too O
late, O
they O
realize O
that O
they're O
only O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
moment, O
and O
the O
moment O
never O
lasts. O

first O
the O
new O
sound O
is O
a O
novelty, O
an O
ear-catching O
break O
from O
the O
usual O
guitars O
and O
keyboards; O
it O
leaps O
out O
of O
a O
radio O
speaker. O

in O
a O
matter O
of O
years O
or O
months, O
it's O
everywhere: O
first O
the O
imitative O
bands, O
then O
the O
soundtracks O
and O
commercials, O
in O
a O
process O
that O
keeps O
speeding O
up. O

soon O
as O
they O
can O
retool, O
keyboard O
manufacturers O
begin O
to O
include O
a O
pre-set O
simulation O
of O
the O
sound, O
so O
that O
the O
local O
Top O
40 O
band O
can O
start O
inserting O
it O
into O
songs. O

then, O
the O
sound O
is O
forever O
associated O
with O
its O
pop O
moment, O
the O
way O
reverbed O
guitar O
spells O
early-1960s O
surf O
music O
or O
staccato O
synthesizers O
hark O
back O
to O
new-wave O
rock, O
circa O
1979. O

years, O
the O
whistle O
hovered O
under O
the O
pop O
radar. O

Van O
Morrison O
sang O
with O
the O
whistle-toting O
Chieftains I-LOCATION
in O
1988, O
he O
was O
simply O
claiming O
his O
Irish O
heritage. O

Paul O
Simon O
put O
a O
whistle O
solo O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
You O
Can O
Call O
Me O
Al O
on O
Graceland O
in O
1986, O
he O
was O
paying O
direct O
homage O
to O
South O
African O
kwela O
music, O
another O
penny O
whistle O
stronghold. O

there O
was O
no O
rush O
to O
latch O
on O
to O
the O
sound. O

nearly O
a O
decade, O
the O
whistle O
tootled O
on O
in O
easy O
obscurity. O

along O
came O
the O
corporate O
Celtic O
blockbusters O
of O
the O
late O
1990s, O
Riverdance O
and O
Lord O
of O
the O
Dance, O
with O
a O
whistle O
skirling O
while O
ranks O
of O
vigorous O
step-dancers O
clattered O
away O
in O
formation, O
something O
like O
an O
Irish O
Triumph O
of O
the O
Will. O

in O
quieter O
realms, O
New O
Age O
music O
latched O
on O
to O
Celtic O
music O
for O
its O
soothing, O
timeless O
drones O
and O
the O
gentle O
but O
piquant O
tones O
of O
the O
traditional O
instruments. O

ethnicity O
was O
being O
rediscovered O
worldwide, O
the O
Celts O
were O
well O
prepared. O
James O
Horner O
's O
score O
for O
Titanic O
uses O
elements O
of O
both O
Riverdance O
muscle O
and O
New O
Age O
sweetness O
to O
lend O
a O
Celtic O
veneer O
to O
its O
sweeping O
Romantic O
crescendos. O

the O
Celtic O
connection O
is O
that O
the O
Titanic O
was O
built O
in O
Belfast I-LOCATION
.) O
And O
as O
the O
movie O
and O
its O
score O
became O
omnipresent, O
the O
innocent O
whistle O
turned O
into O
something O
else. O

has O
moved O
from O
the O
unassuming O
context O
of O
a O
ceilidh, O
an O
Irish O
jam O
session, O
to O
sail O
above O
an O
orchestra O
and O
to O
parley O
with O
Ms. O
Dion O
; O
it O
has O
become O
an O
implement O
of O
coercive O
tear-jerking. O

doubt O
other O
arrangers, O
even O
now, O
are O
planning O
to O
use O
it O
the O
same O
way. O

GOOD O
A O
SOUND O
TO O
LOSE, O
ULTIMATELY O
Banned O
or O
not, O
the O
whistle O
will O
have O
its O
time, O
then O
recede. O

Clapton O
song, O
five O
years O
hence, O
will O
immediately O
signal O
1998 O
the O
way O
an O
electric O
sitar O
moans O
late O
1960s. O

course, O
the O
whistle O
won't O
disappear O
from O
traditional O
Irish O
groups, O
and O
the O
thriving O
subgenre O
of O
Celtic O
New O
Age O
music O
isn't O
likely O
to O
rule O
it O
out O
either. O

too O
good O
a O
sound O
to O
lose. O

the O
broader O
pop O
arena, O
meanwhile, O
the O
whistle O
will O
fade O
out O
of O
earshot, O
probably O
soon O
after O
it O
turns O
up O
in O
a O
commercial O
for O
some O
deeply O
inappropriate O
product. O

will O
move O
on O
to O
the O
next O
instrument: O
the O
elemental O
honk O
of O
the O
didgeridoo, O
perhaps, O
or O
the O
mellow O
peal O
of O
the O
Indonesian O
trompong, O
a O
set O
of O
tuned O
gongs. O

then, O
in O
15 O
to O
20 O
years, O
some O
sample-happy O
producer O
will O
get O
the O
bright O
idea O
of O
placing O
the O
clear, O
airy O
tone O
of O
the O
whistle O
into O
a O
mix. O

else O
will O
notice O
it O
and O
add O
it O
to O
another O
track, O
and O
it O
will O
spread O
the O
way O
1970s O
wah-wah O
blaxploitation O
guitars O
are O
showing O
up O
all O
over O
the O
place. O

people O
will O
remember O
the O
Titanic O
boom O
as O
simple O
nostalgia O
or O
forgiven O
kitsch. O

children O
will O
note O
their O
parents O
growing O
all O
misty-eyed O
and O
laugh O
or O
join O
them O
with O
a O
tinge O
of O
self-consciousness. O

the O
sound O
of O
breath O
through O
tin, O
they O
will O
imagine O
not O
the O
green O
fields O
of O
Ireland I-LOCATION

but O
the O
whistle's O
days O
in O
the O
big O
time, O
amplified O

ubiquitous, O
when O

enough O

the O
swashbuckler O
who O
is O
the O

subject, O
Dieter O

mostly O
describes O
his O
exploits O
from O
memory. O

a O
garrulous O
extrovert O
living O
a O
comfortable O
life O
near O
San I-LOCATION
Francisco I-LOCATION
, O
he O
talks O
of O
extraordinary O
early O
hardship O
and O
of O
the O
drive O
that O
sustained O
him. O

a O
German O
childhood O
seared O
by O
images O
of O
World O
War O

and O
with O
an O
American O
military O
career O
that O
saw O
him O
shot O
down O
over O
Laos I-LOCATION
in O
1966, O
he O
has O
many O
a O
hair-raising O
story O
to O
tell. O

as O
often O
happens O
in O
Herzog O
's O
haunting O
documentaries, O
the O
most O
interesting O
figure O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
one O
behind O
the O
camera. O

Dengler O
is O
a O
practiced O
raconteur O
and O
has O
his O
story O
amply O
illustrated O
here, O
it O
is O
Herzog O
's O
occasional O
meditations O
on O
his O
subject O
that O
linger. O

a O
child, O
the O
filmmaker O
says O
in O
voice-over, O
Dieter O
saw O
things O
that O
made O
no O
earthly O
sense O
at O
all. O

Germany O
had O
been O
transformed O
into O
a O
dreamscape O
of O
the O
surreal. O

poetic O
images O
of O
wartime O
destruction O
accompany O
that O
observation. O

shots O
of O
voluptuous O
explosions O
in O
the O
jungle O
amplify O
Herzog O
's O
idea O
of O
what O
it O
must O
have O
been O
like O
for O
Dengler O
to O
be O
a O
fighter O
pilot: O
It O
all O
looked O
strange, O
like O
a O
barbaric O
dream. O

Dieter O
Needs O

which O
opens O
on O
Wednesday O
at O
the O
Film I-LOCATION
Forum I-LOCATION

is O
one O
of O
the O
filmmaker's O
least O
exotic O
works, O
but O
it O
straightforwardly O
presents O
Dengler O
's O
eventful O
history. O

speaks O
of O
having, O
as O
a O
boy, O
torn O
wallpaper O
off O
bombed-out O
walls O
so O
that O
his O
mother O
could O
cook O
it, O
since O
there O
were O
nutrients O
in O

glue. O

shows O
the O
camera O
how, O
even O
now, O
memories O
of O
being O
in O
a O
prisoner-of-war O
camp O
lead O
him O
to O
keep O
hundreds O
of O
pounds O
of O
emergency O
provisions O
hidden O
under O
his O
house, O
just O
in O
case. O

to O
Southeast I-LOCATION
Asia I-LOCATION
with O
a O
camera O
crew O
( O
Herzog O
enlists O
villagers O
and O
water O
buffalo O
to O
stand O
impassively O
before O
the O
camera O
and O
provide O
atmosphere), O
Dengler O
describes O
his O
harrowing O
experiences O
as O
a O
prisoner. O

were O
just O
always O
thinking O
of O
something O
to O
do O
to O
me, O
he O
says O
of O
his O
captors, O
from O
whom O
he O
ultimately O
made O
a O
highly O
dramatic O
escape. O
Dengler O
illustrates O
how O
to O
open O
handcuffs O
with O
a O
piece O
of O
wire, O
tells O
of O
biting O
a O
snake O
in O
two, O
even O
shares O
a O
black-tie O
reunion O
dinner O
with O
the O
helicopter O
pilot O
who O
finally O
rescued O
him. O

in O
light O
of O
his O
many O
ordeals, O
his O
pleasant O
chattiness O
begins O
to O
seem O
the O
film's O
strangest O
aspect. O

Herzog O
puts O
it: O
He O
hides O
behind O
the O
casual O
remark O
that O
this O
was O
the O
fun O
part O

OPPONENTS O
MOSCOW I-LOCATION
_ O
In O
a O
meeting O
that O
was O
as O
much O
political O
theater O
as O
substance, O
President O
Boris O
Yeltsin O
summoned O
his O
opponents O
to O
the O
Kremlin I-LOCATION
Tuesday O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
show O
that O
he O
has O
a O
steady O
grip O
on O
the O
reins O
of O
power O
and O
to O
drum O
up O
support O
for O
his O
new O
prime O
minister. O

much O
ballyhooed O
political O
round O
table O
took O
place O
in O
the O
ornate O
St. O
Catherine O
Hall. O

president O
held O
center O
stage O
while O
Sergei O
Kiriyenko O
, O
the O
youthful O
aide O
that O
Yeltsin O
picked O
to O
be O
prime O
minister, O
sat O
by O
his O
side. O

television O
cameras O
captured O
Yeltsin O
as O
he O
served O
notice O
to O
his O
critics O
that O
he O
had O
no O
intention O
of O
abandoning O
Kiriyenko O
. O

projecting O
an O
image O
of O
strength, O
Yeltsin O
portrayed O
himself O
as O
a O
reasonable O
leader O
who O
would O
try O
to O
work O
with O
the O
Communist I-LOCATION
-dominated O
lower I-LOCATION
house I-LOCATION
of O
parliament I-LOCATION
. O

the O
meeting O
itself O
was O
something O
less O
than O
definitive. O

the O
two-hour O
session O
ended, O
the O
back-room O
negotiating O
over O
the O
Kiriyenko O
nomination O
went O
on. O

think O
it O
was O
a O
purely O
cosmetic O
event, O
said O
Yevgeny O
Volk O
, O
the O
director O
of O
the O
Moscow I-LOCATION
office O
of O
the O
Heritage I-LOCATION
Foundation I-LOCATION
. O

we O
are O
talking O
about O
is O
bargaining. O

tactical O
terms, O
Yeltsin O
conducted O
a O
round O
table O
so O
that O
the O
Communists I-LOCATION
and O
nationals I-LOCATION
could O
say O
their O
pressure O
on O
the O
government O
had O
been O
answered. O
Volk O
, O
however, O
expressed O
the O
dominant O
view O
in O
Moscow I-LOCATION
that O
Yeltsin O
would O
ultimately O
succeed O
in O
winning O
parliamentary O
approval O
of O
Kiriyenko O
's O
appointment. O

the O
key O
question O
increasingly O
appears O
to O
be O
not O
whether O
Kiriyenko O
will O
be O
approved O
but O
what O
the O
cost O
will O
be O
in O
terms O
of O
symbolic O
or O
substantive O
concessions O
by O
Yeltsin O
in O
new O
appointments O
or O
programs. O

be O
sure, O
Yeltsin O
was O
not O
the O
only O
one O
striking O
poses. O
Gennadi O
Zyuganov O
, O
the O
communist I-LOCATION
leader, O
declared O
after O
the O
meeting O
that O
the O
Communists I-LOCATION
would O
not O
back O
Kiriyenko O
's O
appointment O
when O
his O
nomination O
comes O
before O
Parliament I-LOCATION
on O
Friday. O

that O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
the O
Communists I-LOCATION
are O
determined O
to O
block O
the O
nomination O
indefinitely. O

political O
analysts O
believe O
that O
the O
Communists I-LOCATION
are O
determined O
to O
appear O
resolute O
before O
a O
national O
day O
of O
protest O
scheduled O
for O
Thursday. O

Zyuganov O
was O
careful O
not O
to O
exclude O
the O
possibility O
that O
the O
Communists I-LOCATION
might O
eventually O
acquiesce O
in O
the O
nomination. O
Vladimir O
Zhirinovsky O
, O
the O
nationalist I-LOCATION
leader O

suggested O

Grigory O

was O
the O
most O
adamant O
in O
the O

appears O
to O
be O
calculating O
that O
the O
influence O
of O

will O
increase O
if O

If O
the O
Parliament I-LOCATION
rejects O
Yeltsin O
's O
choice O
for O
prime O
minister O
three O
times, O
the O
president O
can O
disband O
the O
parliament I-LOCATION
and O
call O
for O
new O
parliamentary O
elections. O

parliamentary O
deputies O
are O
loath O
to O
compete O
in O
such O
early O
elections O
and O
prefer O
to O
hold O
on O
their O
posts O

as O
long O
as O
possible. O

Tuesday's O
meeting O
was O
designed O
to O
avoid O
a O
confrontation. O

the O
session, O
Yeltsin O
said O
he O
had O
considered O
several O
other O
choices, O
including O
Yegor O
Stroyev O
, O
the O
head O
of O
the O
upper I-LOCATION
house I-LOCATION
of O

and O
Moscow I-LOCATION
major O
Yuri O
Luzhkov O
, O
before O
settling O
on O
the O
35-year-old O
Kiriyenko O
. O
Yeltsin O
praised O
Kiriyenko O
's O
professionalism O
and O
said O
that O
his O
new O
government O
could O
include O
candidates O
from O
opposing O
factions. O
Kiriyenko O
is O
to O
propose O
a O
list O
over O
the O
next O
week O
of O
officials O
that O
would O
serve O
in O
the O
new O
government. O
Yeltsin O
grandly O
declared O
that O
1998 O
should O
be O
a O
year O
without O
confrontation, O
overlooking O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
had O
not O
bothered O
to O
consult O
the O
parliament I-LOCATION
of O
most O
of O
his O
own O
government O
before O
picking O
Kiriyenko O
and O
ordering O
his O
surprise O
government O
shake-up O
I O
will O
not O
veto O
your O
decisions O
and O
you O
should O
abstain O
from O
bans, O
Yeltsin O
said. O

The O
American O
people O
are O
pretty O
solid, O
they're O
pretty O

they O
know O
what's O

why O
they're O
not O
screaming O

yelling O
about O
Bill O

TRIBAL O
ARTISANS? O
LOOK O
AGAIN O
As O
a O
freshman O
in O
college O
some O
30 O
years O
ago, O
I O
was O
a O
literature O
major O
with O
a O
problem: O
I O
had O
a O
token O
science O
requirement O
to O
fulfill. O

solution? O
I O
took O
a O
course O
titled O
Primitive O
Art. O
It O
was O
taught O
by O
the O
anthropology O
department, O
and O
classes O
were O
held O
in O
the O
local O
museum O
of O
natural O
history, O
where O
African O
sculptures O
were O
jumbled O
in O
with O
geological O
specimens O
and O
stuffed O
birds. O

status O
of O
those O
sculptures O
has O
changed O
over O
time. O

more O
often O
than O
not, O
they've O
found O
a O
home O
in O
art O
museums. O

art O
as O
a O
field O
of O
study O
is O
listed O
under O
art O
history, O
and O
no O
field O
of O
research O
is O
more O
stimulating O
or O
innovative. O

none O
carries O
so O
heavy O
a O
burden O
of O
misconceptions. O

of O
these O
has O
to O
do O
with O
the O
identity O
of O
African O
artists. O

collectors O
rarely O
took O
note O
of O
who O
carved O
the O
spectacular O
statues O
and O
masks O
they O
shipped O
back O
to O

. O

ethnology, O
with O
which O
the O
study O
of O
African O
art O
still O
overlaps, O
concentrates O
on O
social O
traditions O
and O
belief O
systems O
rather O
than O
things, O
and O
seldom O
has O
an O
eye O
out O
for O
authorship. O

whatever O
reason, O
the O
idea O
has O
long O
been O
current O
in O
the O
West O
that O
anonymity O
in O
art O
was O
a O
cultural O
norm O
in O
Africa I-LOCATION
. O

this O
thinking, O
African O
art O
is O
a O
collective, O
tribal O
phenomenon O
rather O
than O
a O
vehicle O
for O
individual O
expression, O
and O
objects O
of O
a O
specific O
type O
are O
_ O
making O
allowances O
for O
varying O
degrees O
of O
skill O
_ O
interchangeable. O

head-on O
