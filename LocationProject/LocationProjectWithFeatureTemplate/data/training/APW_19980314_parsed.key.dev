Long-awaited
Vatican
statement
on
Holocaust

VATICAN
CITY
(

_
More
than
10
years
after
it
was
promised
in
a
meeting
with
Jewish
leaders,
a
major
Vatican
document
on
the
Holocaust
is
ready.

Vatican
said
Saturday
the
document
would
be
made
public
on
Monday.

groups
have
been
keenly
awaiting
the
document
to
see
if
it
will
continue
to
heal
Jewish-Catholic
relations.

last
Vatican
document
of
landmark
proportions
on
Jewish
relations
was
a
1965
statement
that
came
out
of
the
Second
Vatican
Council
under
Paul
VI
.

Aetate
(In
Our
Times)
condemned
anti-Semitism
and
said
the
Jews
cannot
be
collectively
blamed
for
the
crucifixion
of
Jesus
.

John
Paul
II
has
dedicated
much
of
his
nearly
20-year-old
papacy
to
improving
relations
of
the
church
with
Jews,
whom
he
refers
to
as
older
brothers,
after
centuries
of
animosity.

of
the
latest
document
first
came
on
Sept.

1987,
during
a
meeting
between
the
pope
and
Jewish
leaders
in
Castel
Gandolfo
,
the
pontiff's
summer
residence
in
the
hills
southeast
of
Rome
.

unprecedented
meeting
was
hurriedly
called
as
anxiety
built
in
the
Vatican
that
Jews
might
boycott
a
ceremony
during
the
then
soon-approaching
papal
visit
to
the
United
States
.

were
angered
by
the
pope's
audience
earlier
that
year
with
then
Austrian
President
Kurt
Waldheim
,
who
was
been
accused
of
helping
deport
Jews
to
Nazi
concentration
camps,
allegations
he
denied.

Castel
Gandolfo
meeting
was
the
first
time
Jewish
representatives
had
sat
down
for
informal
discussions
with
a
pope.

at
the
1987
meeting
said
the
Vatican
planned
to
publish
a
major
document
dealing
with
anti-Semitism
and
the
genocide
of
European
Jews
by
the
Nazis
in
World
War
II.

that
meeting,
John
Paul
has
presided
over
several
milestones
that
improved
relations
with
Jews,
including
the
establishment
of
diplomatic
relations
with
Israel
in
1995.

ground-breaking
step
was
the
pope's
visit
to
Rome
's
main
synagogue
in
1986.

fall,
the
pope
told
a
Vatican
seminar
on
anti-Jewish
currents
in
Christian
theology
that
centuries
of
anti-Jewish
prejudice
had
figured
in
deadening
Christian
resistance

the
Nazi
persecution
of
Jews.

to
the
disappointment

of
